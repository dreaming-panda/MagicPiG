("Question: Manny is making lasagna for dinner with his four friends, Lisa, Raphael, Aaron, and Kai. He needs to know how many pieces to cut the lasagna into to serve it. Manny only wants one piece. Aaron doesn't like lasagna much and will probably only eat garlic bread and salad. Kai is always hungry and will eat twice as much as Manny. Raphael always eats half the amount Manny does, but his sister Lisa loves lasagna and will eat two pieces, plus any Raphael has left of his piece. How many pieces should Manny cut his lasagna into?\nAnswer: Manny will eat 1 piece.\nAaron will eat 0 pieces.\nKai will eat twice as much as Manny, so he will eat 2 * 1 = <<2*1=2>>2 pieces.\nRaphael will eat half as much as Manny, so he will eat 1 * 1/2 = 1/2 piece.\nLisa will eat 2 pieces plus the remainder of Raphaelâ€™s piece, so she will eat 2 + 1/2 = 2 1/2 pieces.\nTogether, they will eat 1 + 0 + 2 + 1/2 + 2 1/2 = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 pieces.\nThus, Manny should cut his lasagna into 6 pieces.\n#### 6\n\nQuestion: John builds a toy bridge to support various weights.

He has 3500 gold coins. He wants to spread this equally across 5 chests. Additionally, he will put a total of 500 silver coins and twice as many bronze coins as silver, all distributed equally across the chests. How many coins in total will be in each chest?\nAnswer: There will be 3500 gold coins / 5 chest= <<3500/5=700>>700 gold coins in every chest.\nSo, there will be 500 silver coins / 5 chests = <<500/5=100>>100 silver coins in each chest.\nThen, the number of bronze coins is double the number of silver coins, so there are 2 * 500 = <<2*500=1000>>1000 bronze coins.\nSo there will be 1000 bronze coins / 5 chests = <<1000/5=200>>200 bronze coins in each chest.\nFinally, the total number of coins in every chest will be 700 gold coins + 100 silver coins + 200 bronze coins = <<700+100+200=1000>>1000 coins.\n#### 1000\n\nQuestion: Janet buys 45-pound containers of cat litter for $21 each.
