But a new documentary by Aviva Kempner explores Rosenwald's lesser-known role as a Jewish philanthropist who brought education to thousands of African-American children at a time when most had no schools to attend, reports the Root. \"It's a wonderful story of cooperation between this philanthropist who did not have to care about black people, but who did, and who expended his considerable wealth in ensuring that they got their fair shake in America,\" civil rights leader Julian Bond explains in Rosenwald, out next month. It tells of Rosenwald's rise from the son of a peddler to a clothing manufacturing apprentice to CEO of the largest US retailer, Sears, Roebuck & Co., in 1908, reports the Times of Israel. It was around that time he began to see similarities between the treatment of blacks in America and pogroms against European Jews. When his rabbi became an NAACP leader, Rosenwald sponsored meetings. Soon after, he donated $25,000 to Alabama's Tuskegee University, led by Booker T. Washington, whose writings on racial equality and education had piqued his interest. Washington suggested the money go toward building six schools for black children, but Rosenwald contributed just a third of the funds and pushed the black and white communities to raise the rest. He went on to give $62 million to various causes, including the Rosenwald Fund, which created 5,300 schools in the South, attended by prominent African-Americans like Maya Angelou, George Wolfe, and Eugene Robinson.

A blood residue analysis of the tool revealed animal proteins consistent with bison, the most likely species being Bison antiquus, an extinct ancestor of the modern buffalo. The discovery of this tool below a layer of undisturbed ash that dates to 15,800 years old means that this tool is likely more than 15,800 years old, which would suggest the oldest human occupation west of the Rockies.\n\nThe discoveries at Rimrock Draw Rockshelter have the potential to challenge the existing understanding of the early human occupation in the western United States, as they could provide evidence of a much older human presence in the region. The findings also highlight the importance of continued archaeological research and the need for more evidence before making irrefutable claims.

The Pacific Fishery Management Council is urged to take measures to maintain a healthy Pacific Ocean by setting conservative catch limits and fulfilling its commitment to prohibit unregulated fishing on forage fish species. The decline of sardines has significant implications for the West Coast's marine ecosystem, including the loss of food sources for commercially important fish, seabirds, whales, sharks, and dolphins. The decline is also affecting the fishing industry, with steep cuts in the amount fishermen are allowed to catch. The reasons for the decline are unclear, but scientists suspect it may be due to a naturally occurring climate cycle known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. The decline of sardines has also raised alarm due to their value as \"forage fish,\" small but nutrition-packed species that form the core of the ocean food web. The lack of prey fish is starving ocean predators, including sea lions, and causing malnourished pups to wash up on beaches. The articles emphasize the need for further research to understand the causes of the decline and to take appropriate measures to protect the Pacific sardine population and the West Coast's marine ecosystem.", "answers": ["The West Coast sardine population was down 72% since 2006 per a fall assessment—the worst crash since the mid-20th century, and one with far-reaching implications, particularly since the steep decline is expected to continue. One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans—which also depend on sardines for food—are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)—and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same. Scientists now, as then, aren't sure how to divide the blame between ocean conditions (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a climate cycle, has brought cold, sardine-unfriendly water to the area) and overfishing.

The study analyzed 50 homes in the Austin area and found that west-facing panels are more effective at capturing solar energy late in the afternoon, which coincides with the time when homeowners tend to use the most electricity, particularly for air conditioning. The study suggests that homeowners with west-facing panels are optimizing their solar power generation at precisely the time that their own usage surges, and when the utility company needs the most help coping with demand.

In Mexico, a species of snake that had been \"lost\" for almost 80 years has been re-discovered on a remote island. The Clarion nightsnake was found again on one of the Revillagigedo Islands, more than 400 miles (650 kilometers) off Mexico's Pacific coast. The original sighting of the species was made by American naturalist William Beebe in 1936, but subsequent visits failed to find more nightsnakes, and no further sightings were reported over the years from the island, which is inhabited only by a small detachment of Mexican marines. However, Daniel Mulcahy, a researcher for the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, suspected it might still exist, and he and Juan Martinez Gomez of Mexico's Ecology Institute set out to find it. The researchers performed DNA analysis to establish the long, dark spotted snake as its own species and see where it had come from, and the tests showed it is most closely related to snakes from Mexico's Sonora-Sinaloa coast more than 500 miles (800 kilometers) away. The National Museum of Natural History said Mulcahy \"uncovered the controversy surrounding the inclusion of this snake in the scientific record, and found that it appears to be the only species ever to be discarded due to a presumed locality error.\"\n\nIn a separate discovery, a lost species of snake that eluded scientists for nearly 80 years has been rediscovered in Mexico.

She also talks about her songwriting process and how she approaches her friendships and relationships with the media.", "answers": ["During an extensive cover interview with Chuck Klosterman for GQ, the only time Taylor Swift \"appears remotely flustered,\" Klosterman writes, is when he relays a story to her about meeting a former acquaintance of Swift's a few years back who called her \"calculating.\" Swift \"really, really hates the word calculating,\" Klosterman writes. \"She despises how it has become tethered to her iconography and believes the person I met has been the singular voice regurgitating this categorization.\" Swift's defense: \"Am I shooting from the hip? Would any of this have happened if I was? In that sense, I do think about things before they happen. But here was someone taking a positive thing—the fact that I think about things and that I care about my work—and trying to make that into an insinuation about my personal life. Highly offensive.

Dlisted, Celebuzz, and Gigwise think it's likely Edward Droste, member of the indie rock band Grizzly Bear, who earlier this year called Swift not only calculating but frightening, mean, rude, and arrogant (though he at first wouldn't say who he was talking about). As for the rest of the GQ interview, Swift also discusses the rumor that her song \"Bad Blood\" is about Katy Perry (she basically fueled the rumor because she didn't want anyone to think the song was about one of her exes) and the VMAs moment when Kanye West stormed the stage and interrupted her acceptance speech. \"That was the most happenstance thing to ever happen in my career,\" she says. \"And to now be in a place where Kanye and I respect each other—that's one of my favorite things that has happened in my career.\" Click for the full piece."], "all_classes": null, "length": 7213}

He was 47 years old. According to the Los Angeles County Coroner's office, Armstrong's death is being investigated as a suicide.\n\nArmstrong's relationship with Taylor had been rocky, with allegations of physical and emotional abuse made by Taylor against Russell. In July, Taylor filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences. However, in an interview with People magazine around the same time, she also alleged that Russell had physically abused her. Russell denied the allegations in the interview, saying \"Did I push her? Yes, maybe things happened in the heat of the moment, but it was during a time in our lives that was not characteristic of who we were. This show has literally pushed us to the limit.\"\n\nIn January, Armstrong talked to The Daily Beast about the husbands of Real Housewives, saying \"I didn’t really understand what we were getting into.\" He also stated that financial pressures and working all the time added to his stress. Armstrong had filed for bankruptcy in 2005 and recent reports indicated that he was again in financial trouble.\n\nAccording to a friend of Armstrong's, he had been feeling down and withdrawn in the days leading up to his death.

The study, conducted by researchers at the National Institutes of Health, found that women who ate two to four servings of boiled, mashed, baked potatoes or chips per week had a 27% increased risk of diabetes during pregnancy. The risk increased to 50% for those who consumed more than five portions of potatoes or chips per week. The study suggests that substituting potatoes with other vegetables, legumes, or whole grains may help lower the risk of gestational diabetes. The researchers propose that the high glycemic index of potatoes may contribute to the increased risk of diabetes. The study also found that women who ate more than one serving of potatoes per week had a higher risk of gestational diabetes, but no more than one serving per week was considered safe. The study's limitations included the lack of diversity in the participant population and the fact that diet details and diabetes diagnosis were self-reported.

So suggests a National Institutes of Health study published Tuesday in the BMJ that found women who eat more potatoes before becoming pregnant may be more likely to develop gestational diabetes as compared to their spud-light counterparts. That finding stems from an analysis of 15,632 women who participated in the Nurses' Health Study II over a 10-year period beginning in 1991. A press release explains the women had not previously had gestational diabetes, and at four-year intervals answered questions related to their diet in the year prior. Under the potato category, they were asked to rate their consumption of baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes, fries, or potato chips on a scale of \"never\" to \"six or more times a day.\" The researchers begin their study by noting just how prevalent potato consumption is, with 35% of American women ages 19-50 eating potatoes daily, and the vegetable accounting for 8% of their caloric intake. Study author Dr. Cuilin Zhang recommends to CBS News that women cap it at one potato portion per week and consider a swap. The researchers estimate that trading two servings of potatoes weekly for a substitute vegetable, legumes, or whole-grain food would reduce the risk of gestational diabetes—which CBS reports affects as many as 8% of pregnancies—by 9% to 12%. As for why women should care, Zhang tells the BBC that women with gestational diabetes can develop pre-eclampsia and hypertension, which \"can adversely affect the fetus\" and put the mother at higher risk of developing Type 2 diabetes.

The much-assailed decision was one made by owner Russell Brice, who had grown fearful of a 900-foot-wide overhang of glacial ice set directly above the main route on the mountain's Nepal side, an overhang that his members were directly under for as long as an hour while traversing the route.

Here's what some of the experts are saying: Slash Film argues you can't blame Spielberg for the failure, as he's far from the first director to flop when adapting a story by Roald Dahl. In fact, only one film based on a Dahl book—Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory—has made more than $34 million in US theaters. The Wrap has a list of seven reasons The BFG bombed, from \"Roald Dahl is no JK Rowling\" to a lack of stars and a confusing title. The BFG might be proof it's time for Spielberg to step away from family films, according to the Hollywood Reporter, which points out the director hasn't had a hit family film since Hook a quarter of a century ago. He's had better luck with recent grown-up fare like Lincoln and Bridge of Spies. The Wall Street Journal details Spielberg's history of being able to \"bounce back\" after cinematic disappointments, something he should have a good chance of doing with his next three films currently including a historical drama, a science-fiction movie based on a popular book, and an Indiana Jones sequel. But the \"reason this stings\" is because every other time Spielberg disappointed at the box office, it was with a \"good for you\" film, according to Forbes. Whereas The BFG was intended as a money-maker for the studio. Finally, Movie Pilot argues that the failure of The BFG shouldn't count against any future Spielberg or Dahl movies. \"The main issue of the movie is more about being unremarkable than disastrous.”"], "all_classes": null, "length": 4655}

Passage 2 explores the evolutionary perspective on sexism, arguing that low-status males increase female-directed hostility to minimize the loss of status due to hierarchical reconfiguration resulting from the entrance of a woman into the competitive arena. The study used an online first-person shooter video game to test the hypothesis that female-initiated disruption of a male hierarchy incites hostile behavior from poor performing males. The results showed that lower-skilled players were more hostile towards a female-voiced teammate, especially when performing poorly. In contrast, higher-skilled players behaved submissively towards a male-voiced player in the identical scenario.

The study gauged a remote player's skill by measuring such factors like kills and deaths. Researchers found men were typically cordial to players they believed to be male, and that more skilled men who kicked first-shooter butt were less likely to direct negative comments toward female-voiced players than their less skilled male counterparts. But lamer players tended to take their frustrations out on female players with more frequent, caustic comments. A lead author notes that gaming provides the perfect breeding ground for this kind of behavior: After all, the Post notes, players can remain anonymous, they may never run into an online teammate or opponent again, and it's a significantly male-biased recreation. Females threaten gamers' \"pre-existing social hierarchy\"; the guys at the bottom of the virtual totem pole feel threatened and therefore become more threatening to those they think they can quash the easiest. \"As men often rely on aggression to maintain their dominant social status, the increase in hostility towards a woman by lower-status males may be an attempt to disregard a female's performance and suppress her disturbance on the hierarchy to retain their social rank,\" the study notes.

This information was discovered during a National Security Council review of the government's policy on \"unmasking\" the identities of individuals in U.S. who are not targets of electronic eavesdropping but whose communications are collected incidentally.\n\nThe pattern of Rice's requests was discovered in February by the National Security Council's senior director for intelligence, Ezra Cohen-Watnick, who was conducting a review of the unmasking policy. Rice's requests were made during the final months of the Obama administration, and it is unclear why she sought the identities of these individuals.\n\nThe news outlets also reported that House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes knew about unmasking and leaking back in January, before President Trump's tweet in March alleging wiretapping. Nunes has faced criticism from Democrats for viewing pertinent documents on White House grounds and announcing their contents to the press.\n\nFinally, the articles highlighted the double standard involved in the situation, as Rice did not spread the information she unmasked, according to a former national security official who spoke with Bloomberg View on the condition of anonymity.\n\nIn summary, the news outlets reported on new revelations regarding the Obama administration's handling of surveillance during the 2016 presidential election, including the discovery that former National Security Adviser Susan Rice requested the identities of U.S. persons in raw intelligence reports on dozens of occasions, and the criticism faced by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes for his knowledge of unmasking and leaking.", "answers": ["Former Obama national security adviser Susan Rice is back in the news again, this time regarding President Trump's wiretapping allegations. On the right, she is being accused of abusing her power while in office to \"unmask,\" for political advantage, the names of Trump associates caught up in intelligence surveillance. Trump critics, meanwhile, say the story doesn't amount to much and accuse the White House of trying to divert attention from the president's wiretapping allegations. A look at coverage: A key story comes from Eli Lake at Bloomberg News. He reported Monday that Rice requested the identities of Trump transition officials who were mentioned, but not named, in US intelligence reports. Those reports were mostly summaries of monitored conversations between foreign officials talking about the Trump transition, but sometimes between Trump associates and foreign officials. (The National Security Council logs of Rice's requests are apparently what Rep. Devin Nunes went to the White House to view.) Lake's piece raises questions about why Rice wanted those names revealed—she didn't respond to the story—but he also notes that her requests \"were likely within the law.\" He adds that the story doesn't \"vindicate\" Trump's unsupported accusation that Obama wiretapped Trump Tower. Adam Housley of Fox News also reported on Rice's requests, and his appearance on the network prompted Trump himself to weigh in via tweet: \"Such amazing reporting on unmasking and the crooked scheme against us by @foxandfriends. 'Spied on before nomination.' The real story.\" A post at Slate notes that Trump associates are under FBI investigation over allegedly improper communications with Russians, \"so there may well have been urgent, legal reasons for Rice to have wanted information about the relationships between specific Trump-related figures and foreign individuals.\" But the editorial page at the Wall Street Journal accuses the media and Democrats of hypocrisy. It wants any Trump-Russia ties investigated, but complains that the \"media have been running like wildebeest after that story while ignoring how the Obama Administration might have abused domestic surveillance for its political purposes. Americans deserve to know the truth about both.\" On CNN, Don Lemon accused the \"right-wing media\" of helping the White House try to divert attention from the controversy over Trump's wiretapping claims, adding that his show will not \"aid and abet people who are trying to misinform you, the American people, by creating a diversion,\" he said, per Mediaite. The conservative NewsBusters blog accused ABC, NBC, and CBS of covering up the story by failing to report on the \"massive revelation\" Monday in their evening broadcasts. On MSNBC Tuesday morning, frequent Trump critic Joe Scarborough blasted the New York Times for not having the story on its front page. \"What is Susan Rice unmasking names for and spreading them across the government,\" he asked on Morning Joe, per Mediaite. But the Times story on the subject (inside the paper) generally downplayed the significance of Rice's requests: \"Former national security officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, described the requests as normal and said they were justified by the need for the president’s top security adviser to understand the context of reports sent to her by the nation’s intelligence agencies.\""], "all_classes": null, "length": 4159}

The Interfraternity Conference, which represents 75 national fraternities, opposed the ban and emailed and met with university administrators. The conference also paid for a study that opposed the ban and spurred a three-year campaign by student leaders. The university lifted the restriction this year, and freshmen deaths from fraternity-related events have decreased. Fraternities have taken steps to protect students, including banning alcohol at recruiting events and supporting sanctions against violators. However, drinking deaths at fraternities are \"heartbreaking,\" and many students drink too much, not just at fraternities. The Interfraternity Conference believes that delaying rush makes a lot of sense, and keeping out freshmen merely puts a \"Band-Aid\" on a broader campus problem. If colleges restrict recruitment for a semester or a year, they could next extend the delay through sophomore year or shut down fraternities. The financial consequences of fraternity membership can be devastating, and they devolve not on the 18-year-old \"man\" but on his planning-for-retirement parents. The opposing positions on this matter are held by Douglas Fierberg, the best plaintiff's attorney in the country when it comes to fraternity-related litigation, and Peter Smithhisler, the CEO of the North-American Interfraternity Conference.

As Bloomberg reported, 60 students have died in frat-related incidents since 2005, a fact \"that is dwarfed by the numbers of serious injuries, assaults, and sexual crimes that regularly take place in these houses,\" writes Flanagan. She chronicles a few incidents, from a freshman girl's heinous rape at Wesleyan University to a young man who fired a bottle rocket out of his butt at Marshall University—and the guy who fell off a deck videotaping it, and later sued Alpha Tau Omega for his injuries. To avoid financial ruin, fraternities have merged into \"vast national organizations\" that buy liability insurance, and they've created rules about alcohol consumption that are nearly impossible for party-lovers to follow—so when the inevitable lawsuits come, frat members are considered at fault for breaking the rules. That means their soon-to-be-retired parents pay extensive legal bills, and parents' homeowners insurance often pays settlements. So why do universities allow this perilous environment to persist? Largely because fraternity dorms save schools \"untold millions of dollars\" in housing, writes Flanagan, and the frat-house party image helps lure students into expensive universities.

As with most debates on climate change—particularly when talking about a single weather event—the views are all over the map. And some are suggesting that we need to frame the question differently to get the most accurate response. The details: Wrong question: Did climate change cause Harvey? That's not the right question, writes Dino Grandoni at the Washington Post. \"The better way to frame thinking about the connection is through the question: Does climate change make storms like Harvey more likely?\" This is a theme repeated in multiple posts on the subject, and Grandoni thinks the answer is yes, for reasons spelled out below. 'Worsened': One of the most cited pieces is from Penn State professor Michael Mann in the Guardian. \"We can't say that Hurricane Harvey was caused by climate change,\" he writes. \"But it was certainly worsened by it.\" The three big factors: Higher ocean levels made the storm surge worse, warmer water made the storm more intense, and Harvey stayed \"locked in place\" thanks to atmospheric changes brought on by humans. (The latter was the subject of a paper by Mann.) Maybe 'slightly': University of Washington atmospheric scientist Cliff Mass is skeptical the link is that strong. \"You really can't pin global warming on something this extreme,\" he tells Fox News. \"It has to be natural variability. It may juice it up slightly but not create this phenomenal anomaly.\" Link is 'unknown': Texas State climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon thinks it's too early to assess any link. \"The climate change impact on the strength of Harvey is unknown,\" he writes to CNN. \"Climate change is expected to increase the intensity of the strongest storms, but it's not clear whether Harvey was in that category.\" Still, he notes that heavier rain in general is a \"direct consequence\" of climate change, and Harvey certainly fits that pattern. Too 'fussy': David Leonhardt at the New York Times thinks \"it's time to shed some of the fussy over-precision about the relationship between climate change and weather.\" The evidence is overwhelming that human-caused climate change results in storms such as Harvey, he writes, and our timidness in admitting it is holding up solutions. All about the rain: The jury is out on whether climate change increases the frequency of hurricanes, writes David Roberts in a wide-ranging Q&A at Vox. But he, too, says it's clear that heavier rain is an undisputed consequence. \"In fact, due to sea level rise and more moisture in the air, I expect flooding to be the most frequent public face of climate change over the next decade or so.\" Media coverage: You won't hear much about climate change in the current news coverage because reporters don't want to \"politicize\" the situation, writes Naomi Klein at the Intercept. \"But here's the thing: Every time we act as if an unprecedented weather event is hitting us out of the blue, as some sort of Act of God that no one foresaw, reporters are making a highly political decision,\" she notes.

There have been at least 12 instances of sophisticated foreign hackers gaining remote access to the control systems that run the US electric grid over the past decade. These hackers have the capability to cause widespread blackouts without being detected.\n3. The power grid's aging, outdated systems make it vulnerable to cyber threats. Many substations and equipment are decades old and were never designed with network security in mind, making them easy targets for hackers.\n4. Contractors selling software and equipment to energy companies can also pose a risk to the grid's security. Attackers have successfully used these outside companies as a way to get inside networks tied to the grid.\n5. The rush to tie smart meters, home programmable thermostats, and other smart appliances to the grid is causing fresh vulnerabilities. These devices can be hacked, and their security is flimsy.\n6. The Department of Homeland Security has identified the energy sector as a critical infrastructure, and has taken steps to help utilities improve their cyber defenses. However, the full extent of cyber attacks on the grid is not publicly known.\n7.

She made these allegations in an open letter published in The New York Times and has been supported by her brother, Moses Farrow, who defended Allen against their mother, Mia Farrow.\n2. The burden of proof for assuming that a person is lying is high, especially for famous individuals like Woody Allen. The Daily Beast writer argues that it is important to presume Allen is innocent until proven guilty, while the presumption of innocence until proven guilty does not apply to Dylan Farrow's allegations.\n3. A famous film director, Woody Allen, has been accused of sexual assault by multiple individuals, including his daughter, Dylan Farrow. However, there is a lack of concrete evidence to support these allegations, leading to a he-said-she-said situation.\n4. The debate surrounding sexual assault and rape culture has been ongoing for years, with many calling for a shift in the burden of proof to favor the accuser. The #MeToo movement has highlighted the widespread nature of sexual harassment and assault, and there is a growing recognition of the need to take allegations of sexual misconduct seriously.\n5. The Farrow family has been divided by the allegations, with Moses Farrow defending Woody Allen against his mother. This has led to a painful and emotional debate, with both sides accusing each other of manipulation and abuse.\n6. The case of Woody Allen and Dylan Farrow highlights the complexity of sexual assault allegations and the challenges of proving them. It also underscores the need for a fair and impartial investigation process to ensure that justice is served.\n\nIn summary, the news passages provide a snapshot of the ongoing discussions and debates surrounding sexual assault and rape culture. The case of Woody Allen and Dylan Farrow is a high-profile example of the challenges of proving allegations of sexual misconduct and the need for a fair and impartial investigation process.", "answers": ["Moses Farrow, brother to Dylan Farrow and adopted son of Woody Allen, minces no words when it comes to his sister's allegations of sexual abuse at the hands of their father: \"Of course Woody did not molest my sister,\" Moses, 36, tells People. \"She loved him and looked forward to seeing him when he would visit. She never hid from him until our mother succeeded in creating the atmosphere of fear and hate towards him.\" He goes on to say that on the day in question, everyone who was in the house was in public, and neither Woody nor Dylan ever went off privately. \"I don’t know if my sister really believes she was molested or is trying to please her mother,\" Moses says, claiming that Mia Farrow often hit him when he was a child and went into rages if she was not obeyed. Moses is now estranged from his mother and many of his siblings, but is close to Allen and his wife, Moses' adopted half-sister Soon-Yi Previn. Moses calls the whole fiasco Mia's \"vengeful way to pay [Allen] back for falling in love with Soon-Yi.\" In a piece written last month, Allen documentarian Robert B. Weide noted that while Moses, 15 at the time Dylan accused Allen, initially refused contact with his father, he recently told Weide he's now \"finally seeing the reality\" of what happened and used the term \"brainwashing.\" Dylan was quick to respond to her brother's public change of heart: She tells People, \"My brother is dead to me,\" adding, \"My mother never coached me. She never planted false memories in my brain. My memories are mine. I remember them.\" She also denies her mother hit anyone. Moses isn't the only one publicly doubting Dylan's story: Stephen King made waves Monday when he responded to a New Inquiry piece on the allegations by saying, \"Boy, I’m stumped on that one.

{"pred": " In a recent study, researchers have discovered the likely cause of the mysterious death of the crew of the Confederate submarine H.L. Hunley during the American Civil War. The study, published in the journal Plos One, suggests that the crew died due to a blast wave generated by the sub's own torpedo, which was filled with black powder and attached to a pole from the ship's hull. The blast wave hit the sub's hull, which was less than an inch thick, and bent ever so slightly but fast enough to transfer the blast wave to the inside of the cabin. The wave then traveled through the cabin, hitting each of the eight crew members, and probably caused the blood vessels in their lungs to rupture, leading to their death. The study's lead author, biomechanics engineer Rachel Lance, designed a model of the Hunley, one-sixth the length of the full-scale submarine, and set off test explosions near the model to simulate the blast wave. The experiment showed that the blast wave could have caused the crew's death without leaving any visible trace. The study provides a plausible explanation for the crew's sudden and mysterious death, which has puzzled historians and scientists for over 150 years.", "answers": ["For more than 150 years, researchers have scratched their heads over a Civil War mystery—and now a Navy engineer says she's solved it.

Over three years, Lance—a Duke grad student with no experience in forensics, no help from experts who'd long been on the case, and no access to the excavated sub itself—carried out what Gizmodo calls an \"exhaustive … analysis\" and finally arrived at a conclusion published in PLOS ONE: that the torpedo created blast waves that pierced the Hunley's hull and instantly killed the eight crew, whose skeletons were found intact during the sub's excavation near Charleston, SC, in 2000. Lance looked at other theories swirling around the Hunley's fate, including low oxygen or a bullet fired by the Housatonic that punctured the sub. She became obsessed, to the point she'd zone out during meals. \"There was something viscerally terrifying about the fact that eight people died that night, and we had no idea how or why,\" she tells Hakai. Her injury biomechanics background finally led her to her shock wave theory. \"When blast waves hit an air space, they slow down like a car hitting a wall,\" she says. \"Except in this case, the wall is the surface of the lungs.\" A mini replica of the Hunley she dubbed the CSS Tiny and a series of test explosions in a rural pond helped her prove her theory, per CNN.

The plan also includes a $1 trillion infrastructure program, but does not include new funding amounts or a tax mechanism for it. The budget extensively targets Obama programs and investments focused on climate change, seeking to eliminate payments to the United Nations' Green Climate Fund and cut research funding for climate, ocean, and earth science programs. The proposed budget also includes a $1.5 billion infusion for the border wall and eliminates the National Endowment for the Arts, legal aid for the poor, low-income heating assistance, and the AmeriCorps national service program. The budget goes after frequent targets of the party's staunchest conservatives, such as foreign aid and domestic agencies that had been protected by former President Barack Obama. The proposal covers only roughly one-fourth of the approximately $4 trillion federal budget and does not address taxes, Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. The budget is expected to land with a thud on Capitol Hill, with opposition Democrats outraged over cuts to pet programs and Republicans irate over planned elimination of a program to restore the Great Lakes.

The Environmental Protection Agency and the State Department are the hardest-hit agencies according to budget previews, with cuts of around 30%. Military spending would be beefed up by $54 billion under the proposal, $1.5 billion is earmarked for a border wall, and Homeland Security would get a 6.8% funding increase.

He said that White House officials had looked at Trump's campaign speeches, and \"turned those policies into numbers.\" The New York Times reports that congressional Republicans have already declared parts of the plan dead on arrival. \"The administration’s budget isn’t going to be the budget,\" Sen.

Co-payments would go away, and people would pay premiums based on their incomes, reports the AP. Private insurers would still exist, but for things such as elective plastic surgery or, sometimes, to act as middlemen between the government and hospitals or doctors. A 'right': Sanders makes his case in an op-ed in the New York Times. \"Guaranteeing health care as a right is important to the American people not just from a moral and financial perspective; it also happens to be what the majority of the American people want.\" 'Single payer': David Leonhardt of the New York Times has a Q&A on the fundamentals, including the basic question of what the term \"single payer\" means. In short, it \"describes a system in which only one entity—the government—pays medical bills. If all Americans had Medicare rather than insurance through their jobs, it would be a single-payer system.\" Vox says Sanders' system is far more generous than single-payer plans in Canada and elsewhere. The cost: This could cost hundreds of billions of dollars more per year, per the Journal. Details are yet to come, but Sanders envisions a progressive tax increase, with the wealthy paying more income, capital gains, and estate taxes, reports Newsweek.

Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025.

The actor's main bone of contention with The Day I Met El Chapo: The Kate del Castillo Story: that he thinks the three-episode film hints he assisted the DOJ in helping to capture El Chapo, who was busted right around the time Penn's Rolling Stone article went public. Del Castillo, a Mexican actress, was with Penn when he met with Guzman, and the film is said to take place from her POV. Producer David Broome denies there's anything in the film that says Penn \"is in cahoots\" with the Justice Department and that both he and Netflix tried to see if Penn wanted to take part (Penn reportedly never answered); Netflix backs that up, saying in a statement \"Penn was given the opportunity on multiple occasions to participate.\" Broome says when Penn saw an advance copy of the film, he demanded changes.

{"pred": " In recent news, there have been several developments in the legal system regarding distracted driving and liability for accidents caused by texting while driving. In Pennsylvania, a driver is being sued for wrongful death and negligence after a fatal accident, and two men who texted the driver are also being held liable. In New Jersey, a court ruled that remote texters can be liable if the person they are texting is involved in an accident, and a new law called the \"Kulesh, Kubert, and Bolis Law\" provides criminal penalties for those who are distracted by use of a cell phone while driving and injure others. Additionally, a New York bill called the \"textalyzer\" would allow police officers to take phones from drivers after accidents and determine whether they were using the phone in a way that isn't in accordance with state laws. These developments suggest that society may be shifting in how it views distracted driving and holding remote texters accountable for accidents caused by their actions. However, it remains to be seen how manufacturers or technology that endangers lives will be held accountable for accidents caused by their products.", "answers": ["Court rulings in Pennsylvania and New Jersey are taking texting-while-driving laws down a new road, opening the door to not only holding the offending driver liable for a car accident, but perhaps also the person texting the driver, Consumerist reports. In neither case has anyone (yet) had to legally assume this burden: In the 2013 New Jersey appellate case, the \"remote texter\" was let off the hook because there wasn't enough evidence to show she knew her friend—who severely injured two people after slamming into their motorcycle—was driving when she texted him, the ABA Journal reports. And in the Pennsylvania case, the judge's ruling didn't hold responsible the two texters who were sending messages to the driver when she crashed into a motorcycle, killing that driver—it was simply determined the texters were fair game for the suit, per the Legal Intelligencer. But the fact that holding non-driving texters liable for car crashes is even being considered is starting to slowly impact the legal landscape on distracted driving. The New Jersey and Pennsylvania cases underscore the challenges in such cases. For instance, it's not enough to hold a texter liable simply because he or she texted a driver: Certain conditions must be met, such as knowing (or having good reason to believe) the driver would pick up the phone to check out texts while driving, as well as proving a \"special relationship\" exists between texter and recipient to influence the recipient picking up. But these kinds of cases, as well as other proposed crackdowns on car texters (including New York's controversial \"textalyzer\" bill), show the issue is being given heavier weight. \"People often see distracted driving as a socially acceptable sin … an innocuous guilty pleasure in which everyone indulges,\" a University of South Carolina law professor tells Vocativ. \"The same used to be true of drunk driving ...

{"pred": " A recent study published in the journal Translational Psychiatry has found that older fathers are more likely to have \"geekier\" sons who are more intelligent and focused on their interests. The study analyzed data from over 15,000 twins and found that boys whose fathers were older scored higher on a \"geek index\" measuring traits such as non-verbal IQ, ability to focus, and social aloofness. The study also found that the link between autism and older paternal age is likely due to genetic factors, with geekiness being heritable and transmitted to offspring. However, the study did not find any association between maternal age and geekiness. The findings suggest that delayed fatherhood may lead to a \"society of geniuses\" able to solve the world's problems, but also highlight the risks of older parenting, such as an increased risk of infertility and miscarriage. The study also suggests that some genetic traits inherited from older fathers may contribute to both geekiness and autism.", "answers": ["A new study suggests an upside for boys who have older dads: higher IQs. More specifically, they tend to score higher on what the researchers call the \"geek index,\" reports the Guardian. And this is clearly seen as a positive: \"If you look at who does well in life right now, it’s geeks,\" says Magdalena Janecka at King’s College London. The geek index, she explains, is determined by such factors as ability to focus, non-verbal IQ scores taken at age 12, and social aloofness. The latter trait may sound like a negative, but the BBC frames it as the boys not being overly concerned with fitting in. A mother's age appears to have no impact. The team studied more than 7,000 sets of twins in the UK. The average geek score for boys born to dads 25 or younger is 39. It goes up to 41 when dads had the child between 35 and 44, and jumps to 47 when dads were 50 or older. The impact was less pronounced on girls, and more pronounced when measuring science, tech, engineering, and math scores. Kids born to fathers 50 or older were 32% more likely to earn at least two A's on standardized tests than children born to men aged under 25, the researchers report in Translational Psychiatry. They calculate that 57% of the geek index score is inherited, with possible overlap between genes that contribute to a high geek score and to autism. “Our primary hypothesis is that higher levels of those ‘geeky’ traits in offspring of older men are mainly due is due to characteristics of the fathers themselves,\" Janecka tells Newsweek. \"Men who decide to delay fatherhood often do so due to their extended career and educational pursuits, and likely themselves display higher levels of ‘geekiness.’” (Younger fathers are also likelier to die younger.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 8472}
