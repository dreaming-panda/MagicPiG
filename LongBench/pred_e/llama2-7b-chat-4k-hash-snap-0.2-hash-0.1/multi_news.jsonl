The study also found that the fishes may have evolved mechanisms to clear ice from their circulation, but the long-term consequences of this adaptation are still unknown.\n\nAdditionally, the study found that notothenioid fishes have a unique mechanism to survive in frigid waters.

If the age of the tool holds up to scrutiny, it would be the oldest west of the Rockies, predating the Clovis culture, which is currently believed to be the oldest human occupation in the region.\n\nThe second discovery was made near the Rimrock Draw Rockshelter, where archaeologists found evidence of human occupation dating back over 15,000 years. This includes fragments of camel teeth and a blood residue on a tool made of agate, which suggests that the area was inhabited by early humans.\n\nThe discoveries have been made by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management and the University of Oregon Archaeological Field School, in partnership with the Oregon Archaeological Society. The excavations have been ongoing since 2011, and the findings have yet to be published in a scientific journal.\n\nThe discoveries at Rimrock Draw Rockshelter have the potential to significantly impact our understanding of the early human occupation in the western United States, particularly in light of the recent discoveries at Paisley Cave in Oregon, which are also believed to be older than the Clovis culture. The findings could also have implications for the broader field of archaeology, as they challenge the current understanding of the timing and pace of human migration across North America.", "answers": ["A small stone tool unearthed in eastern Oregon appears to be so ancient that the history of humans in the area may have to be rewritten, archaeologists say.

The Pacific Fishery Management Council is urged to take conservation measures to protect the species, including setting conservative catch limits and prohibiting unregulated fishing. The decline of forage fish, such as sardines, can have far-reaching impacts on commercially important species like salmon, tuna, and seabirds. Scientists warn that if sardines do not recover soon, the West Coast's marine mammals, seabirds, and fishermen could suffer for years. The reasons for the sardine crash are unclear, but experts point to the naturally occurring climate cycle and overfishing as possible causes. The decline of sardines has already led to malnourished sea lion pups washing up on beaches, indicating that the lack of prey is affecting predators in the ecosystem.

One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans—which also depend on sardines for food—are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)—and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same. Scientists now, as then, aren't sure how to divide the blame between ocean conditions (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a climate cycle, has brought cold, sardine-unfriendly water to the area) and overfishing.

Mitt Romney is seen as the front-runner, with a strong performance in eastern Iowa. Ron Paul is also expected to perform well, particularly among college students. Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich are struggling to gain traction, while Rick Perry has seen a surge in support due to his recent bus tour.\n\nPassage 3 discusses the importance of the county of Black Hawk, where Michele Bachmann's campaign struggled after losing to Rick Perry at the county GOP dinner. Dallas County, where Mitt Romney performed strongly in 2008, is also a key county to watch.\n\nPassage 4 provides additional information on the candidates' performance in different counties. Ron Paul is expected to perform well in Johnson County, which is home to the University of Iowa and has a large number of college students. Linn County, where Cedar Rapids is located, is also a key county to watch.\n\nIn summary, the Iowa caucuses on January 3 will be a crucial first step in the presidential nominating process.

Turnout is everything: If it’s high, that’s probably a good sign for Romney. If it’s low, it’s a good sign for Paul and/or Santorum—depending on where it’s concentrated. Bad weather is thought to favor Paul’s band of enthusiastic supporters. Location, location, location: Romney’s support is strongest in eastern Iowa, Santorum should fare well in the northwest, and Paul is hoping for turnout in college towns such as Ames. Politico highlights 10 counties to watch here. The battle for fourth: If either Newt Gingrich or Rick Perry can pull out a closer-than-expected fourth, they might be able to stay in the race. Last-minute campaigning: Romney held rallies in four cities yesterday, his most since 2008. Paul held forth in a hotel full of journalists in Des Moines, hoping to grab media buzz. And Santorum appeared with the cast of 19 Kids and Counting, the TLC reality show beloved by Iowa homeschoolers. Some intriguing numbers: Paul’s favorability has fallen 21 points in the past week. Only 76% of Santorum’s supporters say they’ll definitely caucus for him.

So suggests a National Institutes of Health study published Tuesday in the BMJ that found women who eat more potatoes before becoming pregnant may be more likely to develop gestational diabetes as compared to their spud-light counterparts. That finding stems from an analysis of 15,632 women who participated in the Nurses' Health Study II over a 10-year period beginning in 1991. A press release explains the women had not previously had gestational diabetes, and at four-year intervals answered questions related to their diet in the year prior. Under the potato category, they were asked to rate their consumption of baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes, fries, or potato chips on a scale of \"never\" to \"six or more times a day.\" The researchers begin their study by noting just how prevalent potato consumption is, with 35% of American women ages 19-50 eating potatoes daily, and the vegetable accounting for 8% of their caloric intake. Study author Dr. Cuilin Zhang recommends to CBS News that women cap it at one potato portion per week and consider a swap. The researchers estimate that trading two servings of potatoes weekly for a substitute vegetable, legumes, or whole-grain food would reduce the risk of gestational diabetes—which CBS reports affects as many as 8% of pregnancies—by 9% to 12%.

The much-assailed decision was one made by owner Russell Brice, who had grown fearful of a 900-foot-wide overhang of glacial ice set directly above the main route on the mountain's Nepal side, an overhang that his members were directly under for as long as an hour while traversing the route. As Krakauer writes, the \"wedge of ice the size of a Beverly Hills mansion\" that broke free and caused last week's avalanche came from \"that same ice bulge\" and killed 16 Sherpas. As for the outsize dangers Sherpas face, some standout points: Between 1921 and 1996, the mountain's death ratio was a treacherous one death for every four completed ascents. Between 1997 and present, the death ratio was one for every 60. Among the reasons it's gotten safer: Climbers tend to pack and use more bottled oxygen, and some take the robust steroid dexamethasone once they hit 22,000 feet, which pares down the risk of developing the often fatal high-altitude cerebral edema and high-altitude pulmonary edema. Sherpas typically have less of the former and none of the latter (and are, of course, the ones lugging those extra oxygen bottles up the mountain).

The study, which was conducted by an international team of ice experts and published in the journal Nature, used satellite data to measure the ice sheet's mass balance and found that it has lost about 200 billion tons of ice per year from 1992 to 2017. The study suggests that the ice sheet is becoming less stable and more susceptible to melting due to climate change.\n\nThe study also found that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is the most affected, with the ice loss rate increasing by 5-fold since 1992. The study suggests that this increase in ice loss is likely due to changes in the ocean surrounding Antarctica, which are causing the ice sheet to melt more quickly.\n\nThe study's findings are concerning because they suggest that Antarctica's ice sheet is more vulnerable to the effects of climate change than previously thought.

Antarctica was losing around 49 billion tons of ice a year in the mid-1990s, which went up to an average 219 billion tons a year between 2012 and 2017, the study found. The researchers, who used satellite data going back more than 25 years, say most of the melting ice comes from the West Antarctic sheet, parts of which are in a \"state of collapse\"—and modest ice growth in the East Antarctic is nowhere near enough to offset it. \"The increasing mass loss that they’re finding is really worrying, particularly looking at the West Antarctic, the area that’s changing most rapidly,\" University of Waterloo glaciologist Christine Dow tells the Washington Post. \"And it’s the area that we’re most worried about, because it’s below sea level.\" Antarctica has lost a total of around 3 trillion tons of ice since 1992 and will be contributing more and more to sea level rise if the current trend continues, warn researchers, who say climate change is the only plausible explanation for the ice loss. \"I think we should be worried.

The study, conducted by researchers at Leiden University in the Netherlands, used MRI scans to compare the brain structures of 25 primiparous women (first-time mothers) before and after their pregnancy. The results showed that pregnancy-related changes occurred in 11 brain regions, including areas involved in emotion, memory, and social cognition. These changes were present even two years after childbirth and were not seen in first-time fathers. The study suggests that sex hormones may play a role in these changes, which could help prepare a mother for the demands of caring for an infant.

The study includes data on 25 Spanish women scanned before and after their first pregnancies, along with 20 women who didn't get pregnant during the study. The brain changes in the pregnancy group emerged from comparisons of those two groups. The results were consistent: A computer program could tell which women had gotten pregnant just by looking at results of the MRI scans. And the changes, first documented an average of 10 weeks after giving birth, were mostly still present two years after childbirth. (Based on prior research findings, the researchers think the brain changes happened during pregnancy). No brain changes were seen in first-time fathers, reports the AP. What's going on? Elseline Hoekzema, a study author at Leiden University in the Netherlands, and colleagues think the differences result from sex hormones that flood the brain of a pregnant woman. In 11 places in the brain, the MRI data indicate reductions in volume of the brain's gray matter, but it's not clear what that means. For example, it could reflect a pruning of the places where brain cells communicate, called synapses. Losing some synapses is not necessarily a bad thing. It happens during a hormonal surge in adolescence, producing more specialized and efficient brain circuits. The researchers suspect that could be happening in the pregnant women, perhaps to prepare a woman for motherhood.

This discovery challenges the current definition of a planet, which has been the subject of debate since the demotion of Pluto in 2006.\n\nBrown and Batygin's findings are based on the observation of a gold ring of objects in the Kuiper Belt that are in a stable orbit around the sun.

According to reports, Rice made the request to unmask the names of 35 individuals associated with the Trump transition, including Trump himself. The unmasking of these individuals was reportedly done for political reasons, rather than for any legitimate national security purpose.\n\nThe news outlets also revealed that White House lawyers had recently discovered that Rice had requested the unmasking of U.S. persons in raw intelligence reports on dozens of occasions during the Trump transition. The reports suggest that Rice's requests were part of a broader effort by the Obama administration to gather intelligence on the Trump transition and to potentially use that information for political purposes.\n\nThe news has raised questions about the scope of the Obama administration's use of surveillance powers and the potential for political abuse of those powers. It has also sparked calls for congressional oversight of U.S. intelligence operations and for greater transparency in the use of surveillance powers.\n\nIn related news, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes has announced that he will investigate the unmasking of Trump transition officials, including Rice's role in the matter. Nunes has also requested that the White House provide him with any information related to the unmasking of U.S. persons in raw intelligence reports.\n\nOverall, the news has raised significant concerns about the use of surveillance powers by the Obama administration and the potential for political abuse of those powers.

Trump critics, meanwhile, say the story doesn't amount to much and accuse the White House of trying to divert attention from the president's wiretapping allegations. A look at coverage: A key story comes from Eli Lake at Bloomberg News. He reported Monday that Rice requested the identities of Trump transition officials who were mentioned, but not named, in US intelligence reports. Those reports were mostly summaries of monitored conversations between foreign officials talking about the Trump transition, but sometimes between Trump associates and foreign officials. (The National Security Council logs of Rice's requests are apparently what Rep. Devin Nunes went to the White House to view.) Lake's piece raises questions about why Rice wanted those names revealed—she didn't respond to the story—but he also notes that her requests \"were likely within the law.\" He adds that the story doesn't \"vindicate\" Trump's unsupported accusation that Obama wiretapped Trump Tower. Adam Housley of Fox News also reported on Rice's requests, and his appearance on the network prompted Trump himself to weigh in via tweet: \"Such amazing reporting on unmasking and the crooked scheme against us by @foxandfriends. 'Spied on before nomination.' The real story.\" A post at Slate notes that Trump associates are under FBI investigation over allegedly improper communications with Russians, \"so there may well have been urgent, legal reasons for Rice to have wanted information about the relationships between specific Trump-related figures and foreign individuals.\" But the editorial page at the Wall Street Journal accuses the media and Democrats of hypocrisy. It wants any Trump-Russia ties investigated, but complains that the \"media have been running like wildebeest after that story while ignoring how the Obama Administration might have abused domestic surveillance for its political purposes. Americans deserve to know the truth about both.\" On CNN, Don Lemon accused the \"right-wing media\" of helping the White House try to divert attention from the controversy over Trump's wiretapping claims, adding that his show will not \"aid and abet people who are trying to misinform you, the American people, by creating a diversion,\" he said, per Mediaite. The conservative NewsBusters blog accused ABC, NBC, and CBS of covering up the story by failing to report on the \"massive revelation\" Monday in their evening broadcasts.

The pretzel croissant, created by Maury Rubin, has gained popularity in New York City, attracting long lines at breakfast time. Dominique Ansel, a renowned pastry chef, introduced the Cronut, a hybrid of a croissant and a doughnut, which became a viral sensation. Dunkin' Donuts has now launched its own version of the Cronut, called the Croissant Donut, which will be available nationwide.\n\nThe rise of the Cronut and other hybrid pastries has led to a reevaluation of the traditional boundaries between different types of bakers. Ferran Adrià, a molecular gastronomy expert, argues that the pastry chef is the true innovator in the kitchen, as they are able to transform humble ingredients into something new and exciting. The competition among bakers is fierce, with each trying to outdo the others in creativity and innovation.\n\nThe popularity of the Cronut has also led to a reexamination of the role of the chef and the baker in modern society. Some see the Cronut as a symbol of the changing nature of food culture, where the lines between high and low, art and commerce, are becoming increasingly blurred. Others see it as a reflection of the increasingly complex and globalized food system, where new ingredients and techniques are constantly being introduced and combined in innovative ways.\n\nIn conclusion, the rise of the Cronut and other hybrid pastries represents a significant shift in the way we think about food and the culinary arts. It highlights the importance of innovation and creativity in the kitchen, and the ways in which chefs and bakers are pushing the boundaries of what is possible with ingredients and techniques.

The strike was carried out by the USS Porter and the USS Fort McHenry, and it targeted the Shayrat air base in Homs province. The US military used Tomahawk cruise missiles in the attack, which caused significant damage to the base and killed at least seven people, including Syrian soldiers and civilians.\n\nThe strike was launched after a series of meetings between US President Donald Trump and his advisors, who were concerned about the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian government. The US had previously threatened to take action against Syria for its alleged use of chemical weapons, and the strike was seen as a way to enforce the US's red line on the use of such weapons.\n\nThe strike was widely condemned by Russia, which supports the Syrian government, and Iran, which has also backed the Syrian government in the civil war. Russia called the strike a \"violation of international law\" and a \"flagrant act of aggression,\" while Iran accused the US of \"supporting terrorism\" in Syria.\n\nThe strike also raised concerns about the potential for further escalation in the Syrian conflict, which has already killed hundreds of thousands of people and displaced millions. The US has been involved in the conflict through its support for rebels fighting against the Syrian government, and the strike could be seen as a sign of increased US involvement in the conflict.\n\nIn addition to the strike on the Syrian air base, the US has also been involved in airstrikes against Islamic State (IS) militants in Syria and Iraq. The US has been working with a coalition of international partners to combat IS, which has been responsible for numerous attacks in the region and around the world.\n\nOverall, the US missile strike on the Syrian air base represents a significant escalation of the US's involvement in the Syrian conflict, and it has raised concerns about the potential for further violence and instability in the region.", "answers": ["President Trump's decision to strike a Syrian airbase in retaliation for a chemical attack on civilians has bipartisan support—and bipartisan opposition.

Here's what some of the experts are saying: Slash Film argues you can't blame Spielberg for the failure, as he's far from the first director to flop when adapting a story by Roald Dahl. In fact, only one film based on a Dahl book—Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory—has made more than $34 million in US theaters. The Wrap has a list of seven reasons The BFG bombed, from \"Roald Dahl is no JK Rowling\" to a lack of stars and a confusing title. The BFG might be proof it's time for Spielberg to step away from family films, according to the Hollywood Reporter, which points out the director hasn't had a hit family film since Hook a quarter of a century ago.

Scientists who conducted the study published in Plos One played 163 games of Halo as either male-voiced players or female-voiced players (82 female, 81 male) with remote teammates and opponents. The study gauged a remote player's skill by measuring such factors like kills and deaths. Researchers found men were typically cordial to players they believed to be male, and that more skilled men who kicked first-shooter butt were less likely to direct negative comments toward female-voiced players than their less skilled male counterparts. But lamer players tended to take their frustrations out on female players with more frequent, caustic comments. A lead author notes that gaming provides the perfect breeding ground for this kind of behavior: After all, the Post notes, players can remain anonymous, they may never run into an online teammate or opponent again, and it's a significantly male-biased recreation. Females threaten gamers' \"pre-existing social hierarchy\"; the guys at the bottom of the virtual totem pole feel threatened and therefore become more threatening to those they think they can quash the easiest. \"As men often rely on aggression to maintain their dominant social status, the increase in hostility towards a woman by lower-status males may be an attempt to disregard a female's performance and suppress her disturbance on the hierarchy to retain their social rank,\" the study notes.

She chronicles a few incidents, from a freshman girl's heinous rape at Wesleyan University to a young man who fired a bottle rocket out of his butt at Marshall University—and the guy who fell off a deck videotaping it, and later sued Alpha Tau Omega for his injuries. To avoid financial ruin, fraternities have merged into \"vast national organizations\" that buy liability insurance, and they've created rules about alcohol consumption that are nearly impossible for party-lovers to follow—so when the inevitable lawsuits come, frat members are considered at fault for breaking the rules. That means their soon-to-be-retired parents pay extensive legal bills, and parents' homeowners insurance often pays settlements. So why do universities allow this perilous environment to persist?

The jury is now in on her remarks, and she may want to appeal.

As with most debates on climate change—particularly when talking about a single weather event—the views are all over the map. And some are suggesting that we need to frame the question differently to get the most accurate response. The details: Wrong question: Did climate change cause Harvey? That's not the right question, writes Dino Grandoni at the Washington Post. \"The better way to frame thinking about the connection is through the question: Does climate change make storms like Harvey more likely?\" This is a theme repeated in multiple posts on the subject, and Grandoni thinks the answer is yes, for reasons spelled out below. 'Worsened': One of the most cited pieces is from Penn State professor Michael Mann in the Guardian. \"We can't say that Hurricane Harvey was caused by climate change,\" he writes. \"But it was certainly worsened by it.\" The three big factors: Higher ocean levels made the storm surge worse, warmer water made the storm more intense, and Harvey stayed \"locked in place\" thanks to atmospheric changes brought on by humans. (The latter was the subject of a paper by Mann.) Maybe 'slightly': University of Washington atmospheric scientist Cliff Mass is skeptical the link is that strong. \"You really can't pin global warming on something this extreme,\" he tells Fox News. \"It has to be natural variability. It may juice it up slightly but not create this phenomenal anomaly.\" Link is 'unknown': Texas State climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon thinks it's too early to assess any link. \"The climate change impact on the strength of Harvey is unknown,\" he writes to CNN. \"Climate change is expected to increase the intensity of the strongest storms, but it's not clear whether Harvey was in that category.\" Still, he notes that heavier rain in general is a \"direct consequence\" of climate change, and Harvey certainly fits that pattern. Too 'fussy': David Leonhardt at the New York Times thinks \"it's time to shed some of the fussy over-precision about the relationship between climate change and weather.\" The evidence is overwhelming that human-caused climate change results in storms such as Harvey, he writes, and our timidness in admitting it is holding up solutions. All about the rain: The jury is out on whether climate change increases the frequency of hurricanes, writes David Roberts in a wide-ranging Q&A at Vox. But he, too, says it's clear that heavier rain is an undisputed consequence. \"In fact, due to sea level rise and more moisture in the air, I expect flooding to be the most frequent public face of climate change over the next decade or so.\" Media coverage: You won't hear much about climate change in the current news coverage because reporters don't want to \"politicize\" the situation, writes Naomi Klein at the Intercept. \"But here's the thing: Every time we act as if an unprecedented weather event is hitting us out of the blue, as some sort of Act of God that no one foresaw, reporters are making a highly political decision,\" she notes.

Over three years, Lance—a Duke grad student with no experience in forensics, no help from experts who'd long been on the case, and no access to the excavated sub itself—carried out what Gizmodo calls an \"exhaustive … analysis\" and finally arrived at a conclusion published in PLOS ONE: that the torpedo created blast waves that pierced the Hunley's hull and instantly killed the eight crew, whose skeletons were found intact during the sub's excavation near Charleston, SC, in 2000.

The bill would be funded by a progressive tax system, and would eliminate the current employer-based healthcare system. Sanders has been advocating for this policy for years, and it has gained momentum among Democratic presidential candidates. Several senators, including Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren, have already co-sponsored the bill. The proposal has received support from various groups, including nurses and activists. However, the bill is unlikely to pass in the current Congress, as Republicans control the Senate and President Trump has opposed similar proposals. Despite this, the push for \"Medicare for All\" continues to gain traction among Democrats, and it is likely to be a major issue in the 2020 presidential campaign.", "answers": ["Bernie Sanders rolled out his vision to overhaul the health care system on Wednesday, one in which everybody would get their insurance from the government through Medicare instead of through their jobs or a private insurer. Sanders calls it the Medicare for All Act of 2017, but you'll also hear phrases such as \"single payer\" and \"universal health care\" used to describe it. One key part missing: details on how to pay for it, though Sanders plans to release a separate paper on that, reports the Wall Street Journal. Coverage: The basics: Per CNN, everybody gets a \"Universal Medicare card,\" which would be used to cover all health bills, from surgeries to dental care to substance abuse treatment. Co-payments would go away, and people would pay premiums based on their incomes, reports the AP. Private insurers would still exist, but for things such as elective plastic surgery or, sometimes, to act as middlemen between the government and hospitals or doctors. A 'right': Sanders makes his case in an op-ed in the New York Times. \"Guaranteeing health care as a right is important to the American people not just from a moral and financial perspective; it also happens to be what the majority of the American people want.\" 'Single payer': David Leonhardt of the New York Times has a Q&A on the fundamentals, including the basic question of what the term \"single payer\" means. In short, it \"describes a system in which only one entity—the government—pays medical bills. If all Americans had Medicare rather than insurance through their jobs, it would be a single-payer system.\" Vox says Sanders' system is far more generous than single-payer plans in Canada and elsewhere. The cost: This could cost hundreds of billions of dollars more per year, per the Journal. Details are yet to come, but Sanders envisions a progressive tax increase, with the wealthy paying more income, capital gains, and estate taxes, reports Newsweek. The senator says higher taxes for families would be offset by the fact that they no longer have to buy insurance. Still, in regard to single-payer systems, \"no one—including Sanders—has truly reckoned with how to pay for whatever system they might support,\" writes Mike Allen at Axios. Litmus test? By all accounts, the chances of it passing a GOP-controlled Congress are precisely 0%. But it's turning into a political litmus test of sorts for Democrats, reports the Washington Post. Sanders has the support of 15 Democratic senators so far, including all of those seen as potential 2020 presidential candidates. Co-sponsors include Elizabeth Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand, Cory Booker, and Kamala Harris.

But Bacon lays out the political and policy reasons why Democrats might avoid \"becoming the party of single payer.\" Relishing the fight: Republicans see a chance to pounce. \"We welcome the Democrats' strategy of moving even further left,\" says Katie Martin, spokesperson for the Senate GOP's campaign organization, per the AP."], "all_classes": null, "length": 12075}

He survived with only a scratch and told a police officer he'd fallen asleep at the wheel. The officer suspected the crash might've been intentional and the 27-year-old spent a night at a mental health facility in Frisco. A day later, the Breckenridge man was released and disappeared, reports the Washington Post. His family told the Summit Daily News McAtee had 10 days earlier stopped taking his medication for bipolar disorder, just as he had done a few times before when he dropped out of sight, but he always resurfaced. Over the next year, they scoured the country in search of him, thinking perhaps he'd gone off the grid like Chris McCandless, the subject of his favorite book, Into the Wild. They reached out to contacts in Alaska, where McAtee had flown planes, and homeless shelters, where they thought he might volunteer, but found no sign of him. In July, McAtee's father wrote online that \"there is a 50% chance that Jack wandered off into the wilderness and attempted to survive.\" But a month later, two hikers found a skull near the top of the Peak One, immediately south of Frisco; DNA confirmation that the skull was McAtee's came earlier this month. \"Our search has come to fruition,\" McAtee's family wrote. \"Our closure is at hand, albeit we acknowledge it will be a lifelong process.\" It's still not clear how or when McAtee died. His skull was all that was found of his remains, reports the Denver Post. What is certain: \"A person, an irreplaceable person, is gone,\" his family says. But \"the story's not over,\" McAtee's father adds. The family is hoping to raise $50,000 to build wells in Kenya in McAtee's memory. Nearly $15,000 has been raised so far.

The Maximum Absorbency Garment system, donned by Gemini and Apollo astronauts, featured one very specific element: a sleeve likened to a condom with a hole at the tip that enabled the men to urinate into a pouch with a one-way valve in their suits. Three sleeve sizes were available, small, medium, and large. And astronauts couldn't fib, explains Rethke. If they decided to order the next size up, the sheath wouldn't fit snugly, and liquid could potentially leak out, causing damage. To make the process a little less embarrassing, the sizes were later renamed: large, gigantic, and humongous. Motherboard notes that the urination issue was first brought to the fore by Alan Shepard, who spent hours in the Freedom 7 capsule in advance of a quick 15-minute \"suborbital hop.\" Denied permission to leave the capsule, he opted to pee in his suit—forcing Mission Control to turn off his biomedical sensors until the flow of oxygen in the suit dried the pee, allowing the sensors to be switched on.

The brutal killings of Heather Aldrich, her sister Carrie Nelson, and Nelson's boyfriend Jody Hutchinson—all of whom were reportedly asphyxiated—and the discovery of their bodies in a burned-out SUV in the woods was linked back to Aldrich's relationship with Kenneth Brunke, who police and locals say was a gun-happy Manistique drug dealer, and his friend Garry Cordell, who tried to tell Brunke that Aldrich, the object of Brunke's affections, was using him for drugs. And Aldrich did steal a cocaine stash from Brunke's yard, which was followed by a text from Brunke ostensibly meant to lure Aldrich to come over for some free morphine. Aldrich headed to Brunke's house, along with Nelson and Hutchinson, which is where the story takes a weird turn. At first Cordell and his girlfriend, Marietta Carlson, confessed they and Brunke had killed the victims, though the stories kept changing; Brunke denied participating. But then, despite what looked to be certain convictions for all three, Carlson died while in custody, and Cordell suddenly dropped a bombshell: He and Carlson had committed all the murders themselves and Brunke hadn't been present (though he says Brunke did help set the car on fire with the victims' bodies in it). What some believe: Brunke may have paid off Cordell, an unemployed drifter, or promised to take care of Cordell's elderly mother if he took the blame. The cryptic statement Cordell offered in court when asked about a money exchange only fueled that suspicion: \"One man shall die so that the other may live.\" Cordell was sentenced to life in prison, per WLUC; Brunke will likely get five years or less for obstructing justice and lying to a cop when he's sentenced Jan. 21.

{"pred": " A recent study published in the journal Translational Psychiatry has found that older fathers are more likely to have \"geeky\" sons, as measured by a \"Geek Index\" score. The study analyzed data from over 15,000 twins and found that boys whose fathers were older than 30 had higher Geek Index scores, compared to boys whose fathers were younger. The study also found that the link between autism and older paternal age is not fully understood and may be due to several factors, including genetic inheritance.\n\nAnother study published in the journal Psychiatry Research found that men who delay fatherhood tend to have more intelligent and focused sons, but the study did not find any similar trend for daughters. The study used a non-verbal IQ test to measure geekiness and found that boys with older fathers scored higher on the test.\n\nWhile the studies suggest that there may be a genetic component to geekiness and autism, the exact mechanisms are not yet fully understood. The findings of these studies have important implications for understanding the complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors that contribute to these conditions.\n\nIn conclusion, the studies suggest that there may be a genetic component to geekiness and autism, and that older fathers are more likely to have \"geeky\" sons. However, the exact mechanisms are not yet fully understood, and more research is needed to determine the causes of these conditions.", "answers": ["A new study suggests an upside for boys who have older dads: higher IQs. More specifically, they tend to score higher on what the researchers call the \"geek index,\" reports the Guardian. And this is clearly seen as a positive: \"If you look at who does well in life right now, it’s geeks,\" says Magdalena Janecka at King’s College London. The geek index, she explains, is determined by such factors as ability to focus, non-verbal IQ scores taken at age 12, and social aloofness. The latter trait may sound like a negative, but the BBC frames it as the boys not being overly concerned with fitting in. A mother's age appears to have no impact. The team studied more than 7,000 sets of twins in the UK. The average geek score for boys born to dads 25 or younger is 39. It goes up to 41 when dads had the child between 35 and 44, and jumps to 47 when dads were 50 or older. The impact was less pronounced on girls, and more pronounced when measuring science, tech, engineering, and math scores. Kids born to fathers 50 or older were 32% more likely to earn at least two A's on standardized tests than children born to men aged under 25, the researchers report in Translational Psychiatry. They calculate that 57% of the geek index score is inherited, with possible overlap between genes that contribute to a high geek score and to autism. “Our primary hypothesis is that higher levels of those ‘geeky’ traits in offspring of older men are mainly due is due to characteristics of the fathers themselves,\" Janecka tells Newsweek. \"Men who decide to delay fatherhood often do so due to their extended career and educational pursuits, and likely themselves display higher levels of ‘geekiness.’” (Younger fathers are also likelier to die younger.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 8472}

The blast killed one person and injured several others.\n\nShortly after, a group of gunmen opened fire on a crowd of people at the Bataclan concert hall, where over 1,000 people were gathered to watch a rock concert. The attackers, who were armed with automatic weapons and explosives, killed at least 89 people and injured many more.\n\nThe gunmen also carried out attacks at several other locations in Paris, including a restaurant, a bar, and a police station. The attacks were met with a massive response from French security forces, who launched a large-scale operation to apprehend the attackers.\n\nThe investigation into the attacks is ongoing, but it is believed that the gunmen were affiliated with IS, which has claimed responsibility for the attacks. The attacks have raised concerns about the threat of terrorism in Europe and the ability of IS to carry out large-scale attacks on Western soil.\n\nIn the aftermath of the attacks, French President Francois Hollande declared a state of emergency and imposed strict security measures throughout the country.

Despite his wife's efforts to help him, he continued to gamble, and his addiction consumed him until he took his own life. The article highlights the dangers of gambling addiction and the ways in which casinos and gambling companies can exploit vulnerable individuals. It also raises questions about the responsibility of these companies to protect their customers from addiction and the need for greater regulation and support for those struggling with gambling addiction.", "answers": ["About 1% of the US population (around 3.2 million Americans) has a gambling disorder, per the National Center for Responsible Gaming—and the Atlantic tells the tragic story of one of those addicts and how a lawsuit took the entire industry to task for his death. Scott Stevens was a successful Ohio finance exec whose life started unraveling in 2006 after a trade show in Vegas. For six years, his gambling habit spiraled out of control: He sneaked off to gamble when his wife thought he was working, embezzled nearly $4 million from his firm, and drained his family's savings—until the day in 2012 he decided to end his life. After his suicide, Stacy started researching gambling addiction (she hadn't even known about her husband's problem) and filed suit against the West Virginia casino where he was a regular, as well as the maker of the slot machines there. Experts relay how casinos track and target addicted gamblers, supply ready flows of cash via on-site ATMs, and offer plenty of perks to keep them coming back. But it's the modern-day slot machines themselves, with deceptive technology called virtual reel mapping, that seem to be designed to lull gamblers into a trance—or what the industry refers to as \"continuous gaming productivity\"—so they don't stop playing. While the casinos and machine manufacturers place the blame for gambling addictions on individuals, Terry Noffsinger, the lead attorney for the Stevens suit, says these addictive machines are not due to \"negligence. It's intentional.\" Stacy Stevens lost her case in West Virginia, but Noffsinger believes the movement to hold casinos accountable for addicts will gain momentum, much like how the tobacco industry eventually paid for sickening its own customers. \"The public is learning more about it,\" he says.
