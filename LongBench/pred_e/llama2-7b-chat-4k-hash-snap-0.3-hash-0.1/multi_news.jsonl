The guards, aged 93 and 94, were indicted last week after prosecutors filed charges against them. The indictment comes after a long-term investigation into the activities of the guards at the Stutthof concentration camp in Poland, where an estimated 65,000 people died.\n\nThe charges against the guards are based on the testimony of Holocaust survivors, including Judith Meisel, who identified one of the guards as a teenage SS officer who taunted and humiliated her and other female prisoners at the camp. Meisel, now 88, has been working with German prosecutors for several years to bring Nazi war criminals to justice.\n\nThe indictment of the two guards is significant because it marks the first time that Nazi war criminals have been charged with murder in Germany since the end of World War II. The charges are based on a new legal theory that allows prosecutors to pursue charges against individuals who supported the operation of concentration camps, even if they did not directly commit murders.\n\nMeisel, who lost her mother at the Stutthof camp, has been working with prosecutors to provide evidence against the guards. She has also been participating in the trial of another former SS guard who is on trial for murder at the same camp.\n\nThe indictment of the two guards is part of a broader effort by German prosecutors to bring Nazi war criminals to justice. In recent years, prosecutors have indicted several other former SS guards and camp officials on charges related to their roles in the Holocaust.\n\nThe case against the two guards is ongoing, and it is expected to go to trial later this year.

She identified one former guard, 94-year-old Johann Rehbogen, as the young SS officer who would taunt female prisoners as they undressed. Prosecutors say the men can't be tied to specific murders, but their work as guards made the killings possible. Meisel—who escaped along with her sister when inmates were sent on a \"death march\" away from the camp in 1945—says she is willing to relive her horrific experiences to help prosecutors. \"This process of seeking answers and finding justice for my mother gives new meaning to my life,\" she says. The two former guards have been charged as accessories to murder, the AP reports. They deny any knowledge of killings at the camp, where thousands were starved to death or froze. Prosecutors say prisoners were also gassed to death, shot, and killed with lethal injections.

Soon after, he donated $25,000 to Alabama's Tuskegee University, led by Booker T. Washington, whose writings on racial equality and education had piqued his interest. Washington suggested the money go toward building six schools for black children, but Rosenwald contributed just a third of the funds and pushed the black and white communities to raise the rest. He went on to give $62 million to various causes, including the Rosenwald Fund, which created 5,300 schools in the South, attended by prominent African-Americans like Maya Angelou, George Wolfe, and Eugene Robinson.

{"pred": " A recent study has revealed a paradoxical effect of antifreeze proteins found in polar marine teleost fishes, which protect them from inoculative freezing by invading ice crystals. However, the accumulation of these stabilized ice crystals could be lethal to the fishes. The study found that the antifreeze proteins also inhibit the melting of ice crystals, even when the temperature rises above the expected freezing/melting point. This means that the fishes may carry internal ice crystals for most of their lives, which could contribute to lifelong accumulation of detrimental internal ice crystals. The study also exposed a potentially antagonistic pleiotropic effect of the antifreeze proteins, as the beneficial freezing avoidance is accompanied by melting inhibition that may contribute to lifelong accumulation of detrimental internal ice crystals.\n\nAdditionally, the study found that notothenioid fishes have evolved mechanisms to survive in anchor ice that exists around Antarctica. Scientists have long known that antifreeze proteins help these fishes survive in frigid waters, but the new study reveals that these proteins may not be as helpful as previously thought. The proteins prevent ice crystals from melting, which could lead to a life-threatening traffic jam inside the fishes' small capillaries.

One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans—which also depend on sardines for food—are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)—and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same. Scientists now, as then, aren't sure how to divide the blame between ocean conditions (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a climate cycle, has brought cold, sardine-unfriendly water to the area) and overfishing.

A press release explains the women had not previously had gestational diabetes, and at four-year intervals answered questions related to their diet in the year prior.

This is a significant increase from the 50 billion tons lost per year in the early 2000s. The study, which was conducted by the European Space Agency and NASA, used satellite data to monitor the state of the White Continent's ice sheet. The findings suggest that global sea levels are likely to rise by 0.6mm annually due to the increased melting.\n\nThe study also highlighted that West Antarctica is experiencing the most significant ice loss, with an estimated 50 billion tons of ice lost each year. This region is home to several glaciers that are rapidly melting due to warm ocean waters. East Antarctica, on the other hand, is showing a small gain in ice mass, likely due to changes in wind patterns.\n\nThe study's lead author, Andrew Shepherd, emphasized that the findings are concerning and suggest that the ice sheet is becoming more unstable.

Trump has responded to Corker's criticism by labeling him \"liddle\" and suggesting that he is not qualified to be secretary of state. The President also claimed that Corker begged for his endorsement before declining to run for re-election.\n3. Corker's comments have sparked a wider debate about Trump's fitness for office and the role of the Republican Party in enabling his rise. Some Republicans have defended Trump, while others have expressed concern about his behavior and the impact it could have on the country.\n4. The feud between Trump and Corker has also highlighted the tensions between the President and the Republican-controlled Congress. Trump has clashed with several GOP lawmakers in recent months, and the party's leadership has struggled to rein him in.\n5.

The much-assailed decision was one made by owner Russell Brice, who had grown fearful of a 900-foot-wide overhang of glacial ice set directly above the main route on the mountain's Nepal side, an overhang that his members were directly under for as long as an hour while traversing the route. As Krakauer writes, the \"wedge of ice the size of a Beverly Hills mansion\" that broke free and caused last week's avalanche came from \"that same ice bulge\" and killed 16 Sherpas. As for the outsize dangers Sherpas face, some standout points: Between 1921 and 1996, the mountain's death ratio was a treacherous one death for every four completed ascents. Between 1997 and present, the death ratio was one for every 60. Among the reasons it's gotten safer: Climbers tend to pack and use more bottled oxygen, and some take the robust steroid dexamethasone once they hit 22,000 feet, which pares down the risk of developing the often fatal high-altitude cerebral edema and high-altitude pulmonary edema. Sherpas typically have less of the former and none of the latter (and are, of course, the ones lugging those extra oxygen bottles up the mountain).

The spacecraft is equipped with seven advanced instruments, including a camera, spectrometer, and particle detector, which will allow scientists to gather detailed information about Pluto's surface and atmosphere.\n\nOne of the most significant discoveries that New Horizons is expected to make is the size of Pluto's atmosphere. Scientists believe that Pluto's atmosphere is much larger than previously thought, and that it may be possible to detect signs of atmospheric activity on the planet's surface.\n\nAnother area of interest is Pluto's surface geology. Scientists believe that Pluto's surface is composed of a mixture of water ice and rock, and that there may be evidence of recent geological activity, such as volcanic eruptions or tectonic activity.\n\nThe New Horizons mission also has implications for the search for extraterrestrial life. By studying the composition and geology of Pluto's surface, scientists may be able to gain insights into the conditions that are necessary for life to exist on other planets and moons in the solar system.\n\nIn addition to Pluto, New Horizons will also fly by the moon Charon, which is the largest moon of Pluto. Charon is believed to have a surface composed of water ice and rock, and scientists hope to gather detailed information about its geology and composition.\n\nOverall, the New Horizons mission is a significant milestone in the exploration of the solar system, and is expected to provide valuable insights into the geology, atmosphere, and potential habitability of Pluto and other objects in the Kuiper Belt.", "answers": ["This is one of the biggest days in the exploration of our solar system since Voyager 2 approached Neptune in 1989—and there may not be a day like it again. According to NASA's calculations, its New Horizons spacecraft flew by Pluto at 31,000mph at 7:49am EDT today; confirmation of that will come tonight, some 13 hours later, reports the AP. The confirmation will mark the completion of NASA's tour of the \"classical nine\" planets, reports the AP, which notes that Pluto was considered a full-fledged planet instead of a dwarf one when the probe began its journey in 2006. Some things to know about the historic flyby, which comes 50 years to the day after the first successful flyby of Mars: New Horizons will have to capture a vast amount of data in a short time. The probe will be pushed to its limits as it pivots to capture photos and information on Pluto and its moons Charon, Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra during the flyby. \"I can't wait to get into the data and really start making sense of it. Right now, we're just standing under the waterfall and enjoying it,\" principal New Horizons scientist Alan Stern tells the BBC. We don't know whether it was a success. The probe is far too busy to \"phone home,\" the AP notes, but it's expected to send a confirmation signal at around 9pm tonight. The eagerly awaited first photos from the flyby should be released tomorrow night, the Guardian reports, though it will take 16 months to send all the data from the flyby back to Earth. We've already learned a lot of new things about Pluto. \"The science we've already made is mouth-watering,\" says Stern. \"The Pluto system is enchanting in its strangeness and its alien beauty.\" Among NASA's findings in recent days: Pluto's North Pole has an icy cap and the planet's diameter is 1,597 miles across, not 1,471 miles as previously thought. The finding suggests the planet contains a lot more ice and a lot less rock than thought, the Christian Science Monitor reports. There are still a lot of mysteries to be solved. Scientists hope the first close-up look at Pluto's surface will explain features like heart- and doughnut-shaped features recently spotted for the first time. LiveScience notes that new information from Pluto could help explain how our own planet formed and how life began. \"There's a feeling among scientists that Pluto probably will tell us what the early solar system looked like and it's now locked in deep freeze and maybe it will tell us what we once were, a long time ago,\" the director of the Deep Space Communication Complex tells Reuters. The Australian facility will be first to receive new information from the spacecraft. New Horizons isn't done. New Horizons will keep traveling into the Kuiper Belt debris field and beyond after it passes Pluto, National Geographic notes, and it may have more research to do if NASA approves funding.

Brown and Batygin have been studying the Kuiper Belt, a region of icy bodies and other small celestial objects beyond Neptune, for years and have found evidence of a gravitational force that could only be explained by the presence of a large, undiscovered planet.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine has sparked excitement in the scientific community, with many hailing it as a major breakthrough in our understanding of the solar system. However, the discovery is not without controversy, as some scientists have raised questions about the validity of the evidence and the criteria used to define a planet.\n\nMeanwhile, the demotion of Pluto to dwarf planet status in 2006 continues to be a source of debate and outrage among some scientists and the public. Pluto killer Mike Brown has been at the center of this controversy, with some arguing that he should be credited with the discovery of Planet Nine.

The study, conducted by researchers at Leiden University in the Netherlands, found that pregnancy-related changes in the brain occur in 11 specific areas, including those involved in emotion, memory, and social cognition. The study included 25 Spanish women who were scanned before and after their first pregnancy, and the results showed that these brain changes were present an average of 10 weeks after giving birth and were still present two years later. The study also found that these changes were not seen in first-time fathers. The researchers believe that the sex hormones present during pregnancy are responsible for these changes, which may help a mother understand her infant's needs and prepare for motherhood. The study's findings suggest that the brain continues to change throughout a woman's life, and that hormonal changes during pregnancy play a significant role in shaping the brain.", "answers": ["Pregnancy affects not only a woman's body: It changes parts of her brain, too, a new study published in Nature Neuroscience says. The study includes data on 25 Spanish women scanned before and after their first pregnancies, along with 20 women who didn't get pregnant during the study. The brain changes in the pregnancy group emerged from comparisons of those two groups. The results were consistent: A computer program could tell which women had gotten pregnant just by looking at results of the MRI scans. And the changes, first documented an average of 10 weeks after giving birth, were mostly still present two years after childbirth. (Based on prior research findings, the researchers think the brain changes happened during pregnancy). No brain changes were seen in first-time fathers, reports the AP. What's going on? Elseline Hoekzema, a study author at Leiden University in the Netherlands, and colleagues think the differences result from sex hormones that flood the brain of a pregnant woman. In 11 places in the brain, the MRI data indicate reductions in volume of the brain's gray matter, but it's not clear what that means. For example, it could reflect a pruning of the places where brain cells communicate, called synapses. Losing some synapses is not necessarily a bad thing. It happens during a hormonal surge in adolescence, producing more specialized and efficient brain circuits.

The research suggests that the universe is expanding at a faster rate than previously thought, with the distance between galaxies increasing by approximately 45 miles per second per megaparsec. This discrepancy between the observed expansion rate and the predicted rate based on the Big Bang's energetic leftovers is a major concern for cosmologists, as it may indicate the presence of unknown physical processes or the need to revise our understanding of the universe's structure and evolution. The study also highlights the ongoing effort to accurately measure the Hubble constant, which is crucial for understanding the universe's expansion history and the nature of dark energy, dark matter, and dark radiation.

For the record, they calculate the rate to be 45.5 miles per second per megaparsec, the latter being the equivalent of 3.26 million light-years. It's surprising, UPI reports, because astronomers expected the calculations to jibe with previous ones conducted by NASA and the European Space Agency.

Peter Hotez of the Baylor College of Medicine says that mosquito eggs lying around in vessels such as tires and buckets may start hatching en masse once the floodwaters pull back, and if enough of those eggs come from Zika-carrying Aedes aegypti insects, it's going to be \"crunch time.\" Hotez also warns the risk could similarly rise for other diseases linked to mosquitoes, including West Nile. Louisiana so far hasn't had a documented case of Zika contracted locally, though there have been around two dozen cases of travel-related Zika reported there, per the Shreveport Times. But another expert isn't so sure about the Zika risk. Ben Beard, who helps run the CDC's Zika outbreak initiative, concurs there may soon be a proliferation of the blood-hungry mosquitoes in Louisiana due to the massive flooding, but not necessarily of the Zika-carrying kind, as that variety is tinier and therefore more likely to be swept away with the floodwaters. Meanwhile, Zika is already affecting the Bayou State in another way: Per KENS, blood donors are desperately being sought there because locals who've recently traveled to Zika-affected regions can't give blood for about a month after they've come back from their trip, a logistical issue that, along with other factors, has caused a blood shortage in the state.

The country's High Court rejected his application to hear a fresh constitutional challenge to the charges against him, for which he was sentenced to 300 hours of community service. Monis, who declared himself to be a sheikh and a \"spiritual healer,\" was seen as a \"fringe figure\" in Sydney's Islamic community, according to a Guardian profile. Shia Muslim leaders had asked police to probe his claims to be a leading cleric and last week, he announced on his website that he had converted to Sunni Islam and pledged allegiance to ISIS. The lawyer who represented Monis in the murder case tells the Australian Broadcasting Company that his client, who came to the country as a refugee in 1996, may have thought he had \"nothing to lose,\" hence \"participating in something as desperate and outrageous as this.\" He says that while in prison, Monis suffered some \"very unpleasant events, involving matters of excrement over himself and his cell,\" and he is certain that the siege was the act of a \"one-off random individual,\" not an organized terrorist group."], "all_classes": null, "length": 4410}

This move has been met with concern, as it complicates the arming of Syrian rebels by Gulf powers and highlights the ambitions of al-Qaeda to use the Syrian conflict for greater regional goals. The merger also underscores the complexities of the Syrian civil war, which has already seen numerous rebel groups emerge, including the Free Syrian Army, which has struggled to maintain a unified front against the government of President Bashar al-Assad.\n\nThe announcement of the merger between Jabhat al-Nusra and al-Qaeda's Iraqi wing comes at a time when the Syrian opposition is facing increasing pressure from the government and its allies. The Syrian government has consistently spun the propaganda line that the rebellion is a foreign conspiracy relying on terrorists and foreign fighters, and the evidence on the ground suggests that this narrative may be gaining traction. The merger between Jabhat al-Nusra and al-Qaeda's Iraqi wing is likely to further complicate the situation, as it will give the Syrian government a powerful bogeyman to rally its supporters around.\n\nThe situation is further complicated by the fact that Jabhat al-Nusra has been enjoying significant success on the battlefield, with its fighters proving to be among the most effective against the Syrian government. The group's ability to coordinate with other rebel groups and its willingness to engage in brutal tactics have made it a formidable force, and its merger with al-Qaeda's Iraqi wing is likely to give it even more resources and support.\n\nThe implications of the merger are far-reaching, with the potential to impact the entire region.

The Church officially taught plural marriage from 1852 to 1890, when it was officially ended by Church President Wilford Woodruff. The practice was controversial and led to anti-polygamy laws being passed in the US, resulting in the Church losing property and facing civil disobedience from its members. The article highlights the experiences of women and men who participated in plural marriage, including their challenges and difficulties, as well as the spiritual witness they received to support the practice. The Church no longer practices plural marriage today, but members are permitted to perform ordinances on behalf of deceased individuals who practiced plural marriage and are sealed to all their spouses.

The essay explains that Smith was ordered to take multiple wives by an angel who visited him three times between 1834 and 1842; in the last instance, the angel was armed with a sword and threatened a reluctant Smith. The leader, then married to first wife Emma, took his first plural wife, Fanny Alger, in Kirtland, Ohio. Smith and Alger ultimately separated, and the church relocated to Nauvoo, Ill., where he married many more women. The oldest was 56, and the youngest was 14-year-old Helen Mar Kimball; some were already married, a revelation the New York Times describes as the \"biggest bombshell for some.\" The essay explains that a number of marriages, including that with Kimball, were sealed \"for eternity alone,\" suggesting sexual relations weren't involved (the ones that did involve sex were \"for time and eternity\"). What did Emma think of all this? Per the essay, she was none too pleased, though at one time she did accept four of Smith's wives into their home. And what was the reasoning behind what the essay describes as the \"wrenching trial\" of polygamy? Kimball said Smith told her that \"the practice of this principle would be the hardest trial the Saints would ever have to test their faith.\" Two more essays discuss plural marriage in the church's later years; they're part of an effort the church is making to share \"reliable, faith-promoting\" info about its past, the church's historian tells the Times.

The study gauged a remote player's skill by measuring such factors like kills and deaths. Researchers found men were typically cordial to players they believed to be male, and that more skilled men who kicked first-shooter butt were less likely to direct negative comments toward female-voiced players than their less skilled male counterparts. But lamer players tended to take their frustrations out on female players with more frequent, caustic comments.

Females threaten gamers' \"pre-existing social hierarchy\"; the guys at the bottom of the virtual totem pole feel threatened and therefore become more threatening to those they think they can quash the easiest. \"As men often rely on aggression to maintain their dominant social status, the increase in hostility towards a woman by lower-status males may be an attempt to disregard a female's performance and suppress her disturbance on the hierarchy to retain their social rank,\" the study notes.

As Bloomberg reported, 60 students have died in frat-related incidents since 2005, a fact \"that is dwarfed by the numbers of serious injuries, assaults, and sexual crimes that regularly take place in these houses,\" writes Flanagan. She chronicles a few incidents, from a freshman girl's heinous rape at Wesleyan University to a young man who fired a bottle rocket out of his butt at Marshall University—and the guy who fell off a deck videotaping it, and later sued Alpha Tau Omega for his injuries. To avoid financial ruin, fraternities have merged into \"vast national organizations\" that buy liability insurance, and they've created rules about alcohol consumption that are nearly impossible for party-lovers to follow—so when the inevitable lawsuits come, frat members are considered at fault for breaking the rules. That means their soon-to-be-retired parents pay extensive legal bills, and parents' homeowners insurance often pays settlements. So why do universities allow this perilous environment to persist? Largely because fraternity dorms save schools \"untold millions of dollars\" in housing, writes Flanagan, and the frat-house party image helps lure students into expensive universities.

As with most debates on climate change—particularly when talking about a single weather event—the views are all over the map. And some are suggesting that we need to frame the question differently to get the most accurate response. The details: Wrong question: Did climate change cause Harvey? That's not the right question, writes Dino Grandoni at the Washington Post. \"The better way to frame thinking about the connection is through the question: Does climate change make storms like Harvey more likely?\" This is a theme repeated in multiple posts on the subject, and Grandoni thinks the answer is yes, for reasons spelled out below. 'Worsened': One of the most cited pieces is from Penn State professor Michael Mann in the Guardian. \"We can't say that Hurricane Harvey was caused by climate change,\" he writes. \"But it was certainly worsened by it.\" The three big factors: Higher ocean levels made the storm surge worse, warmer water made the storm more intense, and Harvey stayed \"locked in place\" thanks to atmospheric changes brought on by humans. (The latter was the subject of a paper by Mann.) Maybe 'slightly': University of Washington atmospheric scientist Cliff Mass is skeptical the link is that strong. \"You really can't pin global warming on something this extreme,\" he tells Fox News. \"It has to be natural variability. It may juice it up slightly but not create this phenomenal anomaly.\" Link is 'unknown': Texas State climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon thinks it's too early to assess any link. \"The climate change impact on the strength of Harvey is unknown,\" he writes to CNN. \"Climate change is expected to increase the intensity of the strongest storms, but it's not clear whether Harvey was in that category.\" Still, he notes that heavier rain in general is a \"direct consequence\" of climate change, and Harvey certainly fits that pattern. Too 'fussy': David Leonhardt at the New York Times thinks \"it's time to shed some of the fussy over-precision about the relationship between climate change and weather.\" The evidence is overwhelming that human-caused climate change results in storms such as Harvey, he writes, and our timidness in admitting it is holding up solutions. All about the rain: The jury is out on whether climate change increases the frequency of hurricanes, writes David Roberts in a wide-ranging Q&A at Vox. But he, too, says it's clear that heavier rain is an undisputed consequence. \"In fact, due to sea level rise and more moisture in the air, I expect flooding to be the most frequent public face of climate change over the next decade or so.\" Media coverage: You won't hear much about climate change in the current news coverage because reporters don't want to \"politicize\" the situation, writes Naomi Klein at the Intercept. \"But here's the thing: Every time we act as if an unprecedented weather event is hitting us out of the blue, as some sort of Act of God that no one foresaw, reporters are making a highly political decision,\" she notes.

One of the prisoners, Seyed Abolfazl Shahab Jamili, was accused of supplying Iran with nuclear-related equipment and was considered a \"mastermind\" by Iranian officials.

The Obama White House released seven prisoners it characterized as non-dangerous businessmen, neglecting to mention that three of them had been deemed a threat to national security by the president's own Justice Department. (They'd been accused of illegally shipping US macroelectronics to Tehran for use in surface-to-air and cruise missiles.) What's more, Politico found that the US also quietly dropped criminal cases against 14 fugitives, including Seyed Abolfazl Shahab Jamili, who allegedly procured thousands of parts with nuclear applications for Iran by way of China. \"They didn’t just dismiss a bunch of innocent business guys,\" one former federal law enforcement supervisor tells Politico. \"And then they didn’t give a full story of it.\" In fact, Meyer writes, the White House actions \"derailed\" its own successful investigations into Iran's proliferation network, angering Justice Department prosecutors. A senior Obama official acknowledges that anger but says such compromises are necessary and pale in comparison to the greater good of a nuclear deal.

Founded in 1999 by Jack Ma, Alibaba has grown to become one of the largest e-commerce companies in the world, with over 500 million active users. The company's success has been attributed to its innovative business model, which focuses on providing a platform for small businesses to reach a global audience.\n\nPassage 2: The Ebola outbreak in West Africa has highlighted the weaknesses in the global healthcare system, particularly in developing countries. The outbreak has spread rapidly, infecting thousands of people and causing widespread panic. The lack of adequate medical facilities and trained healthcare workers in the affected regions has made it difficult to contain the outbreak, leading to calls for increased investment in global healthcare infrastructure.\n\nPassage 3: Russia's annexation of Crimea has been met with widespread international condemnation, with many countries viewing it as a violation of international law. The move has also led to a significant deterioration in Russia's relations with the West, with many countries imposing economic sanctions on Russia. Despite this, Putin's popularity at home has increased, with many Russians viewing the annexation as a restoration of their country's great-power status.\n\nIn summary, the news passages highlight several significant stories and developments, including the rise of Alibaba, the Ebola outbreak, and Russia's annexation of Crimea.

The study also suggests that the current rate of sea level rise is likely to continue in the future, with the potential for even faster increases as global temperatures continue to rise.\n\nThe study's findings are consistent with previous research, which has shown that sea levels are rising due to a combination of factors, including the melting of glaciers and ice sheets, thermal expansion of the oceans, and changes in ocean currents. The study also notes that the rate of sea level rise is not uniform across the globe, with some regions experiencing faster increases than others.\n\nThe study's findings have important implications for coastal communities and ecosystems, which are already experiencing the impacts of sea level rise.

Lance looked at other theories swirling around the Hunley's fate, including low oxygen or a bullet fired by the Housatonic that punctured the sub. She became obsessed, to the point she'd zone out during meals. \"There was something viscerally terrifying about the fact that eight people died that night, and we had no idea how or why,\" she tells Hakai. Her injury biomechanics background finally led her to her shock wave theory. \"When blast waves hit an air space, they slow down like a car hitting a wall,\" she says. \"Except in this case, the wall is the surface of the lungs.\" A mini replica of the Hunley she dubbed the CSS Tiny and a series of test explosions in a rural pond helped her prove her theory, per CNN. Other researchers remain unconvinced, but Hakai says now Lance's theory is \"their theory to disprove.\" More on her project here.

Co-payments would go away, and people would pay premiums based on their incomes, reports the AP. Private insurers would still exist, but for things such as elective plastic surgery or, sometimes, to act as middlemen between the government and hospitals or doctors.

In short, it \"describes a system in which only one entity—the government—pays medical bills. If all Americans had Medicare rather than insurance through their jobs, it would be a single-payer system.\" Vox says Sanders' system is far more generous than single-payer plans in Canada and elsewhere. The cost: This could cost hundreds of billions of dollars more per year, per the Journal. Details are yet to come, but Sanders envisions a progressive tax increase, with the wealthy paying more income, capital gains, and estate taxes, reports Newsweek.

And Aldrich did steal a cocaine stash from Brunke's yard, which was followed by a text from Brunke ostensibly meant to lure Aldrich to come over for some free morphine. Aldrich headed to Brunke's house, along with Nelson and Hutchinson, which is where the story takes a weird turn.

The latter trait may sound like a negative, but the BBC frames it as the boys not being overly concerned with fitting in. A mother's age appears to have no impact.
