According to Intel, hackers are selling access to Netflix accounts for as little as $10. The accounts include access to the user's viewing history, recommendations, and even their login credentials. This is a major security concern for Netflix users, as it allows hackers to gain access to sensitive personal information.\n\nIn another report, Intel found that hackers are also selling access to Hulu and Amazon Prime accounts on the dark web. The prices for these accounts range from $10 to $50, depending on the level of access the buyer wants.\n\nFormer US Secretary of Homeland Security, Michael Chertoff, warned that the dark web is becoming a major hub for illegal activity, including the sale of stolen personal information. He urged consumers to be vigilant and take steps to protect their personal information, such as using strong passwords and monitoring their credit reports.\n\nIn related news, a recent study found that the average person has 2.5 social media accounts, with the majority of those accounts being on Facebook. This means that there are billions of social media accounts out there that could potentially be hacked and sold on the dark web.\n\nTo make matters worse, many people are using the same password for multiple accounts, which means that if one account is hacked, the hacker can use that password to gain access to other accounts. This is why it's so important to use strong, unique passwords for each account and to enable two-factor authentication whenever possible.\n\nIn conclusion, the dark web is becoming a major hub for illegal activity, including the sale of stolen personal information.

The study suggests that the lifelong accumulation of AFPs may be a trade-off for the benefits they provide in protecting the fish from freezing temperatures.\n\nFurthermore, the study found that the AFPs in notothenia fish have a unique structure that allows them to bind to ice crystals and prevent them from growing, which helps to protect the fish from freezing. The study also found that the AFPs are more effective at protecting the fish from freezing at lower temperatures, which is likely why they are found in Antarctic notothenia fish.\n\nOverall, the study provides new insights into the evolution and function of AFPs in notothenia fish, and highlights the complex and often antagonistic relationships between different proteins in an organism's body.", "answers": ["How do the fish that thrive in the waters around Antarctica prevent their blood from turning to ice? Turns out at least some of them don't. Scientists have long known that the group of fish species known as notothenioids have an antifreeze protein in their blood that prevents them from being frozen to death, but new research has revealed that the same protein keeps ice crystals in their veins, apparently permanently, UPI reports. The crystals melted at a few degrees above freezing, but the fish may spend their whole lives without encountering temperatures that warm, according to research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The antifreeze proteins that prevented the blood from completely freezing also bound itself to the ice crystals, keeping them from getting smaller, the scientists say. Lead researcher Paul Cziko tells the Christian Science Monitor that it's not clear whether the fish have evolved some way of dealing with the ice crystals in their bodies, or if the ice ends up killing them in the long term. \"This shows that with every good evolutionary innovation, some potentially bad or unintended consequences come along with that,\" he says. \"Evolution is a stepwise process.

One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans—which also depend on sardines for food—are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)—and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that each year, at least 2 million people in the US are infected with antibiotic-resistant bacteria, resulting in at least 23,000 deaths. The CDC also notes that the overuse and misuse of antibiotics in human medicine and agriculture contribute to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.\n\nA recent study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) found that the use of antibiotics in the US has increased significantly over the past decade, with a particular increase in the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. The study also found that the use of antibiotics in hospitals and long-term care facilities is higher than in outpatient settings.\n\nThe CDC has identified several \"nightmare bacteria\" that are particularly difficult to treat due to their antibiotic resistance. These bacteria include Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), which can cause severe infections in hospitals and long-term care facilities, and Candida auris, a fungus that is resistant to many antifungal drugs and can cause serious infections in hospitalized patients.\n\nThe CDC has also identified several \"superbugs\" that are resistant to many antibiotics, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), and carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP).

And a new report from the CDC and the Pew Charitable Trusts—the first research to quantify this issue, per the Washington Post—isn't encouraging. A study published Tuesday in JAMA finds nearly one in three antibiotic prescriptions (around 47 million per year) are given needlessly to people with viruses such as bronchitis and the common cold, as well as for ear and sinus infections and sore throats not caused by bacterial infections—meaning the Rx not only won't vanquish their illness, but can potentially build up antibiotic resistance, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Besides the drug resistance, overuse can up the risk for drug allergies and even an unpleasant-sounding diarrhea that can be fatal.

That finding stems from an analysis of 15,632 women who participated in the Nurses' Health Study II over a 10-year period beginning in 1991. A press release explains the women had not previously had gestational diabetes, and at four-year intervals answered questions related to their diet in the year prior. Under the potato category, they were asked to rate their consumption of baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes, fries, or potato chips on a scale of \"never\" to \"six or more times a day.\" The researchers begin their study by noting just how prevalent potato consumption is, with 35% of American women ages 19-50 eating potatoes daily, and the vegetable accounting for 8% of their caloric intake. Study author Dr. Cuilin Zhang recommends to CBS News that women cap it at one potato portion per week and consider a swap. The researchers estimate that trading two servings of potatoes weekly for a substitute vegetable, legumes, or whole-grain food would reduce the risk of gestational diabetes—which CBS reports affects as many as 8% of pregnancies—by 9% to 12%.

The much-assailed decision was one made by owner Russell Brice, who had grown fearful of a 900-foot-wide overhang of glacial ice set directly above the main route on the mountain's Nepal side, an overhang that his members were directly under for as long as an hour while traversing the route. As Krakauer writes, the \"wedge of ice the size of a Beverly Hills mansion\" that broke free and caused last week's avalanche came from \"that same ice bulge\" and killed 16 Sherpas. As for the outsize dangers Sherpas face, some standout points: Between 1921 and 1996, the mountain's death ratio was a treacherous one death for every four completed ascents. Between 1997 and present, the death ratio was one for every 60. Among the reasons it's gotten safer: Climbers tend to pack and use more bottled oxygen, and some take the robust steroid dexamethasone once they hit 22,000 feet, which pares down the risk of developing the often fatal high-altitude cerebral edema and high-altitude pulmonary edema. Sherpas typically have less of the former and none of the latter (and are, of course, the ones lugging those extra oxygen bottles up the mountain).

{"pred": " In the news, astronomers have found evidence of a new planet in the solar system. The planet, called Planet Nine, is believed to be located in the outer reaches of the solar system and is thought to be larger than Earth. The discovery was made using a combination of observations and computer simulations, and the researchers involved in the study say that they are confident that the planet exists.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine is significant because it could help explain some of the unusual features of the Kuiper Belt, a region of the solar system that contains many small, icy bodies. The Kuiper Belt is thought to be the source of many short-period comets, which are comets that take less than 200 years to complete an orbit around the sun. The researchers involved in the study suggest that Planet Nine could be responsible for the observed features of the Kuiper Belt, as it would have a significant gravitational influence on the small bodies in the region.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine is also significant because it could help resolve a long-standing mystery in the solar system. For many years, astronomers have observed a strange pattern of orbits in the Kuiper Belt, in which the small bodies seem to be clustered in a particular region. The researchers involved in the study suggest that this pattern could be explained by the presence of Planet Nine, which would have a gravitational influence on the small bodies in the region.\n\nIn addition to its potential impact on our understanding of the solar system, the discovery of Planet Nine has also sparked interest in the possibility of extraterrestrial life. The researchers involved in the study suggest that the planet could potentially have its own moons, which could provide a habitat for life. While this is purely speculative at this point, the possibility of life existing on Planet Nine is an exciting one that could potentially lead to further research and exploration.\n\nOverall, the discovery of Planet Nine is a significant find that could help us better understand the solar system and its many mysteries. While much more research is needed to confirm the existence of the planet, the evidence so far is compelling and suggests that Planet Nine could be a fascinating and important addition to our understanding of the universe.", "answers": ["Pluto is gonna be PO'd.

Well, Hollywood checked the balance sheet and decided to stop making their kind of mid-budget films, Flavorwire reports. It's all dollars and cents: Thoughtful or offbeat films costing $5 million to $60 million can make moderate profits at best, while blockbusters with international appeal are able to bring in sick money. Paramount's Titanic made that point in 1997 by costing $200 million and earning nearly $2.2 billion worldwide. At that time, mid-budget films like Kiss the Girls and In & Out dominated the Paramount slate and drew modest profits; this year, mega-flicks like Transformers: Age of Extinction, Hercules, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles rule Paramount's roost and earn the big bucks. \"You could make movies in the ten-to-twenty-million-dollar budget range\" at one time, says Susan Seidelman, director of Desperately Seeking Susan. Now, she says, studios \"have to appeal to every demographic in every part of the world.\" And few seasoned directors want to test the indie market, where tons of under-$2 million films are vying for attention. So Spike Lee has funded a film via Kickstarter, Steven Soderbergh publicly quit feature filmmaking last year, and other directors are turning to TV for creative freedom.

Here's what some of the experts are saying: Slash Film argues you can't blame Spielberg for the failure, as he's far from the first director to flop when adapting a story by Roald Dahl. In fact, only one film based on a Dahl book—Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory—has made more than $34 million in US theaters. The Wrap has a list of seven reasons The BFG bombed, from \"Roald Dahl is no JK Rowling\" to a lack of stars and a confusing title. The BFG might be proof it's time for Spielberg to step away from family films, according to the Hollywood Reporter, which points out the director hasn't had a hit family film since Hook a quarter of a century ago. He's had better luck with recent grown-up fare like Lincoln and Bridge of Spies.

The review comes after it was discovered that a former FBI hair analyst had misstated the significance of hair samples in numerous cases, leading to wrongful convictions. The department has acknowledged that the review may lead to the exoneration of some individuals and the reversal of convictions.\n\nThe review is focused on cases dating back to 1985, when the FBI began using a now-discredited hair comparison technique known as microscopic hair comparison. This technique involved comparing the size, shape, and other characteristics of hair samples found at crime scenes with those of a known suspect. However, the technique has been widely criticized for its lack of scientific basis and potential for human error.\n\nThe Justice Department has not provided a specific timeline for the completion of the review, but it has stated that it will notify affected parties and their legal representatives of the results. The department has also announced that it will work with defense attorneys and other stakeholders to address any issues that arise from the review.\n\nIn related news, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has released a report on the reliability of hair comparison analysis. The report found that the technique is not reliable and should not be used in criminal investigations. The NIST report echoes previous findings by the FBI's own scientists, who concluded that the technique was unreliable in 2015.\n\nOverall, the review of criminal cases involving hair analysis is a significant development in the ongoing effort to address issues of wrongful convictions and ensure that justice is served.

The agency's chief, Tony Tooke, is stepping down amid the allegations. An investigation by the PBS NewsHour found that the agency has a history of ignoring or dismissing complaints of sexual harassment and assault. The allegations include instances of sexual assault, groping, and unwanted advances by supervisors and colleagues. The agency has confirmed that it is investigating the allegations and has taken steps to address the problem.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), which oversees the Forest Service, has announced that it will conduct its own investigation into the allegations. The USDA has also promised to take action to address the problem and ensure that the Forest Service is a safe and respectful workplace.\n\nIn response to the allegations, the Forest Service has implemented new policies and procedures to prevent sexual harassment and assault, and to provide support to victims of such behavior. The agency has also established a hotline for employees to report incidents of sexual harassment and assault.\n\nThe allegations of sexual misconduct and a toxic work culture in the Forest Service are not new. In recent years, there have been several high-profile cases of sexual harassment and assault in the agency, including the case of a former Forest Service employee who was sentenced to prison for sexually assaulting a colleague.\n\nThe allegations have sparked calls for reform within the agency and from lawmakers. Some lawmakers have called for the Forest Service to be subject to the same sexual harassment and assault policies as other federal agencies. Others have called for greater transparency and accountability within the agency.\n\nIn conclusion, the allegations of sexual misconduct and a toxic work culture in the U.S. Forest Service are serious and disturbing.

In an extensive Atlantic piece, Caitlin Flanagan looks at the history of fraternities and their myriad ways of avoiding legal obligations for what goes on behind closed doors. As Bloomberg reported, 60 students have died in frat-related incidents since 2005, a fact \"that is dwarfed by the numbers of serious injuries, assaults, and sexual crimes that regularly take place in these houses,\" writes Flanagan. She chronicles a few incidents, from a freshman girl's heinous rape at Wesleyan University to a young man who fired a bottle rocket out of his butt at Marshall University—and the guy who fell off a deck videotaping it, and later sued Alpha Tau Omega for his injuries. To avoid financial ruin, fraternities have merged into \"vast national organizations\" that buy liability insurance, and they've created rules about alcohol consumption that are nearly impossible for party-lovers to follow—so when the inevitable lawsuits come, frat members are considered at fault for breaking the rules. That means their soon-to-be-retired parents pay extensive legal bills, and parents' homeowners insurance often pays settlements. So why do universities allow this perilous environment to persist? Largely because fraternity dorms save schools \"untold millions of dollars\" in housing, writes Flanagan, and the frat-house party image helps lure students into expensive universities. To be fair, advocates also describe the positives—like increased confidence, brotherhood, and leadership training.

As with most debates on climate change—particularly when talking about a single weather event—the views are all over the map. And some are suggesting that we need to frame the question differently to get the most accurate response. The details: Wrong question: Did climate change cause Harvey? That's not the right question, writes Dino Grandoni at the Washington Post. \"The better way to frame thinking about the connection is through the question: Does climate change make storms like Harvey more likely?\" This is a theme repeated in multiple posts on the subject, and Grandoni thinks the answer is yes, for reasons spelled out below. 'Worsened': One of the most cited pieces is from Penn State professor Michael Mann in the Guardian. \"We can't say that Hurricane Harvey was caused by climate change,\" he writes. \"But it was certainly worsened by it.\" The three big factors: Higher ocean levels made the storm surge worse, warmer water made the storm more intense, and Harvey stayed \"locked in place\" thanks to atmospheric changes brought on by humans. (The latter was the subject of a paper by Mann.) Maybe 'slightly': University of Washington atmospheric scientist Cliff Mass is skeptical the link is that strong. \"You really can't pin global warming on something this extreme,\" he tells Fox News. \"It has to be natural variability. It may juice it up slightly but not create this phenomenal anomaly.\" Link is 'unknown': Texas State climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon thinks it's too early to assess any link. \"The climate change impact on the strength of Harvey is unknown,\" he writes to CNN. \"Climate change is expected to increase the intensity of the strongest storms, but it's not clear whether Harvey was in that category.\" Still, he notes that heavier rain in general is a \"direct consequence\" of climate change, and Harvey certainly fits that pattern. Too 'fussy': David Leonhardt at the New York Times thinks \"it's time to shed some of the fussy over-precision about the relationship between climate change and weather.\" The evidence is overwhelming that human-caused climate change results in storms such as Harvey, he writes, and our timidness in admitting it is holding up solutions. All about the rain: The jury is out on whether climate change increases the frequency of hurricanes, writes David Roberts in a wide-ranging Q&A at Vox. But he, too, says it's clear that heavier rain is an undisputed consequence. \"In fact, due to sea level rise and more moisture in the air, I expect flooding to be the most frequent public face of climate change over the next decade or so.\" Media coverage: You won't hear much about climate change in the current news coverage because reporters don't want to \"politicize\" the situation, writes Naomi Klein at the Intercept. \"But here's the thing: Every time we act as if an unprecedented weather event is hitting us out of the blue, as some sort of Act of God that no one foresaw, reporters are making a highly political decision,\" she notes.

After college, he started working as a bookie in Los Angeles. Years later, his wife would tell a former boyfriend, professional gambler RJ Cipriani, that Hanson wanted to put up millions of dollars to fund his efforts at casinos in Australia, per 9 News. The money was to be returned with a casino check, though Cipriani could keep any winnings. Authorities say it was a scheme aimed at hiding money from Hanson's illegal dealings in Australia, where he could sell cocaine for ten times as much as in LA. Cipriani claims he figured this all out and was purposefully reckless at the casino tables to get out of the arrangement; he ended up losing $2.5 million. But his escape plan wasn't that easy. Cipriani says Hanson threatened him and his wife, including by sending them a video of two men being beheaded. \"If you don't pay us our money, this will happen to you,\" an attached note read, according to prosecutors. The US gambler eventually went to the FBI and Hanson was arrested in 2015 in a joint operation with Australian police. He pleaded guilty in January, and has now been ordered to forfeit $5 million in assets. More than 20 of Hanson's associates have also been charged with crimes related to gambling and drug trafficking."], "all_classes": null, "length": 10635}

The study used satellite data to measure the height of the ocean and found that the rate of sea level rise is consistent with the expected impacts of global warming.\n3. Sea level rise threatening coastal communities: A study published on April 11th found that sea level rise is already having significant impacts on coastal communities around the world. The study used data from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to identify areas that are most vulnerable to sea level rise and found that many of these areas are already experiencing flooding and erosion.\n4. Projections of future sea level rise: A study published on April 18th provided projections of future sea level rise based on different scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions.

The flaw was that those locations could be seen by anyone in a group chat, even if the person who sent the message wasn't friends with everyone else in the group.

And Aldrich did steal a cocaine stash from Brunke's yard, which was followed by a text from Brunke ostensibly meant to lure Aldrich to come over for some free morphine. Aldrich headed to Brunke's house, along with Nelson and Hutchinson, which is where the story takes a weird turn. At first Cordell and his girlfriend, Marietta Carlson, confessed they and Brunke had killed the victims, though the stories kept changing; Brunke denied participating.

The bill has already gained support from several Democratic senators, including Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren.\n\nSanders' push for Medicare for All comes as the healthcare system in the US continues to be a contentious issue.

Sanders calls it the Medicare for All Act of 2017, but you'll also hear phrases such as \"single payer\" and \"universal health care\" used to describe it. One key part missing: details on how to pay for it, though Sanders plans to release a separate paper on that, reports the Wall Street Journal. Coverage: The basics: Per CNN, everybody gets a \"Universal Medicare card,\" which would be used to cover all health bills, from surgeries to dental care to substance abuse treatment. Co-payments would go away, and people would pay premiums based on their incomes, reports the AP. Private insurers would still exist, but for things such as elective plastic surgery or, sometimes, to act as middlemen between the government and hospitals or doctors. A 'right': Sanders makes his case in an op-ed in the New York Times. \"Guaranteeing health care as a right is important to the American people not just from a moral and financial perspective; it also happens to be what the majority of the American people want.\" 'Single payer': David Leonhardt of the New York Times has a Q&A on the fundamentals, including the basic question of what the term \"single payer\" means. In short, it \"describes a system in which only one entity—the government—pays medical bills. If all Americans had Medicare rather than insurance through their jobs, it would be a single-payer system.\" Vox says Sanders' system is far more generous than single-payer plans in Canada and elsewhere. The cost: This could cost hundreds of billions of dollars more per year, per the Journal. Details are yet to come, but Sanders envisions a progressive tax increase, with the wealthy paying more income, capital gains, and estate taxes, reports Newsweek. The senator says higher taxes for families would be offset by the fact that they no longer have to buy insurance. Still, in regard to single-payer systems, \"no one—including Sanders—has truly reckoned with how to pay for whatever system they might support,\" writes Mike Allen at Axios. Litmus test? By all accounts, the chances of it passing a GOP-controlled Congress are precisely 0%. But it's turning into a political litmus test of sorts for Democrats, reports the Washington Post.

But Bacon lays out the political and policy reasons why Democrats might avoid \"becoming the party of single payer.\" Relishing the fight: Republicans see a chance to pounce. \"We welcome the Democrats' strategy of moving even further left,\" says Katie Martin, spokesperson for the Senate GOP's campaign organization, per the AP."], "all_classes": null, "length": 12075}

Stevens, who spent 25 years working in the industry, exposed the ways in which slot machines are designed to encourage players to keep playing, even though the odds of winning are often against them.\n\nAccording to Stevens, modern slot machines are designed to provide the illusion of near misses, or near wins, in order to keep players engaged. These near misses are created through the use of virtual reels, which can display symbols that are close to, but not exactly matching, the symbols on the actual reels. This creates the false impression that the player is close to winning, when in fact they are not.\n\nStevens also revealed that the term \"near miss\" is a marketing term used by the industry to describe these deceptive tactics. He claimed that the industry uses this term to make players feel like they are close to winning, even when they are not.\n\nIn addition, Stevens discussed the concept of \"multiline\" play, in which players are able to bet on multiple patterns of paylines. He explained that while this may seem like a good idea, it can actually lead to more losses for players, as they are more likely to hit small pots and lose money overall.\n\nOverall, Stevens' article provided a disturbing look into the ways in which the slot machine industry is designed to take advantage of players.

Experts relay how casinos track and target addicted gamblers, supply ready flows of cash via on-site ATMs, and offer plenty of perks to keep them coming back. But it's the modern-day slot machines themselves, with deceptive technology called virtual reel mapping, that seem to be designed to lull gamblers into a trance—or what the industry refers to as \"continuous gaming productivity\"—so they don't stop playing. While the casinos and machine manufacturers place the blame for gambling addictions on individuals, Terry Noffsinger, the lead attorney for the Stevens suit, says these addictive machines are not due to \"negligence.

{"pred": " A new study has found that older fathers are more likely to have \"geeky\" sons who are intelligent, creative, and have a high IQ. The study analyzed data from over 3,500 twins and found that the risk of autism increased with the age of the father at the time of conception. The research suggests that some genetic traits associated with autism are inherited from older fathers, while other traits may be acquired through environmental factors.\n\nThe study also found that older fathers are more likely to have daughters who are more sociable and outgoing than those fathered by younger men. The researchers suggest that this may be due to the fact that older fathers are more likely to have a higher level of social and emotional intelligence, which they pass on to their daughters.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Sarah Jones, said, \"Our findings suggest that there may be a link between the age of the father and the personality traits of their offspring. While we cannot say for certain why this is the case, it is possible that older fathers are more likely to pass on genetic traits that influence their children's personalities.\"\n\nThe study's findings have implications for parents who are considering having children at an older age. While the study did not find any evidence of a link between paternal age and autism risk, it did suggest that older fathers may be more likely to have children with certain personality traits.\n\nOverall, the study provides new insights into the role of genetics and environment in shaping the personalities of children. While the findings are interesting, it is important to note that the study only looked at a small sample of twins and further research is needed to confirm the results.", "answers": ["A new study suggests an upside for boys who have older dads: higher IQs. More specifically, they tend to score higher on what the researchers call the \"geek index,\" reports the Guardian. And this is clearly seen as a positive: \"If you look at who does well in life right now, it’s geeks,\" says Magdalena Janecka at King’s College London. The geek index, she explains, is determined by such factors as ability to focus, non-verbal IQ scores taken at age 12, and social aloofness. The latter trait may sound like a negative, but the BBC frames it as the boys not being overly concerned with fitting in. A mother's age appears to have no impact. The team studied more than 7,000 sets of twins in the UK. The average geek score for boys born to dads 25 or younger is 39. It goes up to 41 when dads had the child between 35 and 44, and jumps to 47 when dads were 50 or older. The impact was less pronounced on girls, and more pronounced when measuring science, tech, engineering, and math scores. Kids born to fathers 50 or older were 32% more likely to earn at least two A's on standardized tests than children born to men aged under 25, the researchers report in Translational Psychiatry. They calculate that 57% of the geek index score is inherited, with possible overlap between genes that contribute to a high geek score and to autism. “Our primary hypothesis is that higher levels of those ‘geeky’ traits in offspring of older men are mainly due is due to characteristics of the fathers themselves,\" Janecka tells Newsweek. \"Men who decide to delay fatherhood often do so due to their extended career and educational pursuits, and likely themselves display higher levels of ‘geekiness.’” (Younger fathers are also likelier to die younger.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 8472}
