It tells of Rosenwald's rise from the son of a peddler to a clothing manufacturing apprentice to CEO of the largest US retailer, Sears, Roebuck & Co., in 1908, reports the Times of Israel. It was around that time he began to see similarities between the treatment of blacks in America and pogroms against European Jews. When his rabbi became an NAACP leader, Rosenwald sponsored meetings. Soon after, he donated $25,000 to Alabama's Tuskegee University, led by Booker T. Washington, whose writings on racial equality and education had piqued his interest. Washington suggested the money go toward building six schools for black children, but Rosenwald contributed just a third of the funds and pushed the black and white communities to raise the rest. He went on to give $62 million to various causes, including the Rosenwald Fund, which created 5,300 schools in the South, attended by prominent African-Americans like Maya Angelou, George Wolfe, and Eugene Robinson.

Mediation sessions have been extended by 30 days to allow for a possible settlement in the lawsuits related to Nassar's reported sexual assaults. Aly Raisman, a three-time gold medalist and captain of the 2012 and 2016 Olympic teams, has confirmed that she, too, was sexually abused by Nassar. Raisman's revelation comes a month after fellow Fierce Five member McKayla Maroney came forward to say she was abused by Nassar for several years beginning when she was 13. USA Gymnastics has expressed \"great courage\" for Raisman's personal experience and has stated that it wants to work with her and all interested athletes to keep athletes safe.

Nassar has already pleaded guilty to federal child pornography charges and is in jail, awaiting a Dec. 7 sentencing in that case.

The embryo transfers were carried out by Dr. Mats Brannstrom, a professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at Gothenburg University, and his team.\n\nAccording to Brannstrom, three or four of the nine women in the study might successfully give birth, which would be a world first. The women received wombs donated by their mothers or other close relatives, and had in vitro fertilization before the transplants. To prevent rejection of the transplanted womb, the women will have to take drugs throughout their pregnancy and be monitored as high-risk pregnancies.\n\nThe transplant procedure is controversial as it involves accepting wombs donated by living women, which raises ethical questions.

The Pacific Fishery Management Council is urged to take action to maintain a healthy Pacific Ocean by setting conservative catch limits and fulfilling its commitment to prohibit unregulated fishing on forage fish species. The decline of sardines is attributed to a combination of natural fluctuations and overfishing, and scientists warn that if the population does not recover soon, the West Coast's marine mammals, seabirds, and fishermen could suffer for years. The articles also highlight the importance of sardines as a crucial forage fish, providing food for commercially important predators such as salmon and tuna. Additionally, the decline of sardines is linked to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a naturally occurring climate cycle that has brought cold, nutrient-rich water to the West Coast, which has repelled sardines while boosting other species such as market squid. The articles conclude that understanding the causes of the sardine decline and taking appropriate action is crucial to maintaining a healthy and sustainable marine ecosystem.", "answers": ["The West Coast sardine population was down 72% since 2006 per a fall assessment—the worst crash since the mid-20th century, and one with far-reaching implications, particularly since the steep decline is expected to continue.

Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)—and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same. Scientists now, as then, aren't sure how to divide the blame between ocean conditions (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a climate cycle, has brought cold, sardine-unfriendly water to the area) and overfishing.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) conducted a study that found 13% of all outpatient visits result in an antibiotic prescription, with 44% of these prescriptions being written to treat acute respiratory conditions. However, half of these prescriptions are unnecessary due to viral infections. The study also found that doctors are often pressured by patients to prescribe antibiotics, leading to inappropriate prescribing. The CDC has set a goal of reducing inappropriate antibiotic use in outpatient settings by 50% by 2020.\n\nAdditionally, the report ranked the 18 threats (bacteria and fungi) into three categories based on level of concern to human health, identified minimum estimates of morbidity and mortality from antibiotic-resistant infections, and highlighted the gaps in knowledge about antibiotic resistance. The CDC is working towards releasing an updated Antibiotic Resistance Threats Report in fall 2019.\n\nFurthermore, the Pew Charitable Trust and the CDC conducted a study that found nearly a third of antibiotics prescribed in doctors' offices, emergency rooms, and hospital-based clinics in the United States are not needed.

And a new report from the CDC and the Pew Charitable Trusts—the first research to quantify this issue, per the Washington Post—isn't encouraging. A study published Tuesday in JAMA finds nearly one in three antibiotic prescriptions (around 47 million per year) are given needlessly to people with viruses such as bronchitis and the common cold, as well as for ear and sinus infections and sore throats not caused by bacterial infections—meaning the Rx not only won't vanquish their illness, but can potentially build up antibiotic resistance, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Besides the drug resistance, overuse can up the risk for drug allergies and even an unpleasant-sounding diarrhea that can be fatal.

The snake was found on one of the Revillagigedo Islands, located more than 400 miles off Mexico's Pacific coast. The researchers used Beebe's original field notes as a guide and performed DNA analysis to establish the long, dark spotted snake as its own species and see where it had come from. The tests showed it is most closely related to snakes from Mexico's Sonora-Sinaloa coast more than 500 miles away, suggesting that its ancestors may have made the trip from the mainland on a tree trunk felled by a storm and washed out to sea.\n\nThis rediscovery is significant because the Clarion nightsnake was previously struck from the record after scientists were unable to rediscover it. The National Museum of Natural History in Washington DC said that researcher Daniel Mulcahy \"uncovered the controversy surrounding the inclusion of this snake in the scientific record, and found that it appears to be the only species ever to be discarded due to a presumed locality error.\" The re-discovery of the Clarion nightsnake highlights the fragility of island ecosystems, as the Socorro dove, which was once found on the Revillagigedo Islands, went extinct in its natural habitat sometime in the 1970s.

The church has always possessed the stone, but decided to publish the photos to allow people to better understand the religion's roots. The photos show different angles of a dark brown stone with lighter brown swirls, as well as a weathered leather pouch believed to have been made by one of Joseph Smith's wives. The church has been releasing books containing historical documents to shed light on how Smith formed the faith, and has issued a series of in-depth articles to clarify sensitive topics. The new photos peel back another layer of secrecy for a relatively young world religion that has come under scrutiny for some of its beliefs as its numbers swelled in the Internet age. The campaign seems aimed at filling a void on the Internet for accurate information about Mormonism, as curiosity increased while church membership tripled to 15 million over the past three decades.

So suggests a National Institutes of Health study published Tuesday in the BMJ that found women who eat more potatoes before becoming pregnant may be more likely to develop gestational diabetes as compared to their spud-light counterparts. That finding stems from an analysis of 15,632 women who participated in the Nurses' Health Study II over a 10-year period beginning in 1991. A press release explains the women had not previously had gestational diabetes, and at four-year intervals answered questions related to their diet in the year prior. Under the potato category, they were asked to rate their consumption of baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes, fries, or potato chips on a scale of \"never\" to \"six or more times a day.\" The researchers begin their study by noting just how prevalent potato consumption is, with 35% of American women ages 19-50 eating potatoes daily, and the vegetable accounting for 8% of their caloric intake. Study author Dr. Cuilin Zhang recommends to CBS News that women cap it at one potato portion per week and consider a swap. The researchers estimate that trading two servings of potatoes weekly for a substitute vegetable, legumes, or whole-grain food would reduce the risk of gestational diabetes—which CBS reports affects as many as 8% of pregnancies—by 9% to 12%.

The study also found that the melt rate has increased from 76 billion metric tons in the 1992-2011 period to more than 241 billion metric tons in the 2012-2017 period.

The company aims to raise $3.2 billion in the offering and values itself at $24 billion. Snap's IPO Pricing: As soon as March 1, with trading beginning the next day, Expected price: $14-$16 a share. Ticker: SNAP. The lead-up to the Snap IPO has been rocky, with investors appearing initially skeptical of the company after its prospectus revealed some concerning numbers about the business. However, Snap's IPO Pricing and valuation have been praised, with the company valuing itself at nearly 60 times revenue, more than double the 27 times revenue Facebook fetched when it went public in 2012. Snap's roadshow presentation included a kind of tutorial, which explained how the app works, and broke down each part of the app in its prospectus. The company's prospectus also highlighted the importance of Snapchat to its users, how long they spend on the app, and the revenue potential of the emerging trend for young people to communicate with video rather than text. Snap's co-founders, Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy, will each be selling 16 million shares in the IPO, earning them $272 million and $40 million, respectively. Existing investors will have one vote for each of their shares, while new investors will have no voting rights. The company's unique three-share class structure will give Spiegel and Murphy the right of 10 votes for every share. The drone gives a glimpse into what kind of future products Snap may be considering, which would affect the company's growth.

The much-assailed decision was one made by owner Russell Brice, who had grown fearful of a 900-foot-wide overhang of glacial ice set directly above the main route on the mountain's Nepal side, an overhang that his members were directly under for as long as an hour while traversing the route. As Krakauer writes, the \"wedge of ice the size of a Beverly Hills mansion\" that broke free and caused last week's avalanche came from \"that same ice bulge\" and killed 16 Sherpas. As for the outsize dangers Sherpas face, some standout points: Between 1921 and 1996, the mountain's death ratio was a treacherous one death for every four completed ascents. Between 1997 and present, the death ratio was one for every 60. Among the reasons it's gotten safer: Climbers tend to pack and use more bottled oxygen, and some take the robust steroid dexamethasone once they hit 22,000 feet, which pares down the risk of developing the often fatal high-altitude cerebral edema and high-altitude pulmonary edema. Sherpas typically have less of the former and none of the latter (and are, of course, the ones lugging those extra oxygen bottles up the mountain).

The film's poor performance can be attributed to various factors, including its confusing release date, lack of visibility, and the fact that it is an adaptation of a lesser-known Roald Dahl book.\n3. Despite the disappointing box office results, \"The BFG\" has received generally positive reviews from critics, with many praising its visual effects, performances, and faithfulness to the original material.\n4. The film's failure to perform well at the box office could have implications for the future of big-budget, star-studded films like \"The BFG,\" which are increasingly expensive to produce and market.\n5. Spielberg's previous films, such as \"Jurassic Park\" and \"Indiana Jones,\" were also successful at the box office, but their success was not solely due to their star power or marketing campaigns.

Here's what some of the experts are saying: Slash Film argues you can't blame Spielberg for the failure, as he's far from the first director to flop when adapting a story by Roald Dahl. In fact, only one film based on a Dahl book—Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory—has made more than $34 million in US theaters. The Wrap has a list of seven reasons The BFG bombed, from \"Roald Dahl is no JK Rowling\" to a lack of stars and a confusing title. The BFG might be proof it's time for Spielberg to step away from family films, according to the Hollywood Reporter, which points out the director hasn't had a hit family film since Hook a quarter of a century ago. He's had better luck with recent grown-up fare like Lincoln and Bridge of Spies. The Wall Street Journal details Spielberg's history of being able to \"bounce back\" after cinematic disappointments, something he should have a good chance of doing with his next three films currently including a historical drama, a science-fiction movie based on a popular book, and an Indiana Jones sequel. But the \"reason this stings\" is because every other time Spielberg disappointed at the box office, it was with a \"good for you\" film, according to Forbes.

His speech will likely call for boosted sanctions against Iran, but Obama has suggested he would veto any bill giving Congress a chance to legislate on the matter. This weekend, Netanyahu offered conciliatory words, saying he \"respected\" Obama and that \"strength will prevail over differences of opinion.\" Obama will meet Reuters for an interview this afternoon, while National Security Adviser Susan Rice and UN Ambassador Samantha Power speak to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a group Netanyahu will also address, the Times reports. The paper sees the meetings as a chance for the administration to reaffirm its support for Israel. Indeed, John Kerry yesterday noted on ABC's This Week that Netanyahu \"is welcome to speak in the United States, obviously. And we have a closer relationship with Israel right now in terms of security than at any time in history,\" Reuters reports. Kerry tomorrow will join international officials in Switzerland as they look to outline an Iranian deal by the month's end, the Washington Post reports. Kerry has been working closely—too closely, according to some Iranian lawmakers—with Iran's foreign minister to hammer out a deal, the Times reports. \"He has made a huge investment of his time and energy in the talks, and his personal, hands-on involvement in recent months has been crucial to building momentum toward a deal,\" says an analyst. But some worry that Iran could read Kerry's \"eagerness\" as an opening to seek more concessions. Meanwhile, the UN's nuclear agency says Iran is coming up short on providing essential information, Reuters reports. \"The (IAEA) is not in a position to provide credible assurance about the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities in Iran, and therefore to conclude that all nuclear material in Iran is in peaceful activities,\" the agency's chief says."], "all_classes": null, "length": 6018}

The essay explains that Smith was ordered to take multiple wives by an angel who visited him three times between 1834 and 1842; in the last instance, the angel was armed with a sword and threatened a reluctant Smith. The leader, then married to first wife Emma, took his first plural wife, Fanny Alger, in Kirtland, Ohio. Smith and Alger ultimately separated, and the church relocated to Nauvoo, Ill., where he married many more women. The oldest was 56, and the youngest was 14-year-old Helen Mar Kimball; some were already married, a revelation the New York Times describes as the \"biggest bombshell for some.\" The essay explains that a number of marriages, including that with Kimball, were sealed \"for eternity alone,\" suggesting sexual relations weren't involved (the ones that did involve sex were \"for time and eternity\"). What did Emma think of all this? Per the essay, she was none too pleased, though at one time she did accept four of Smith's wives into their home.

According to these reports, former National Security Adviser Susan Rice requested the identities of U.S. persons in raw intelligence reports on dozens of occasions, which were related to the Trump transition and campaign. This information was discovered during a National Security Council review of the government's policy on \"unmasking\" the identities of individuals in U.S. who are not targets of electronic eavesdropping but whose communications are collected incidentally.\n\nThe pattern of Rice's requests was discovered in February by the National Security Council's senior director for intelligence, Ezra Cohen-Watnick, who was conducting a review of the unmasking policy. Rice's requests were made during the final months of the Obama administration, and it is unclear why she sought the identities of these individuals.\n\nThe news outlets also reported that House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes knew about unmasking and leaking back in January, before President Trump's tweet in March alleging wiretapping. Nunes has faced criticism from Democrats for viewing pertinent documents on White House grounds and announcing their contents to the press.\n\nFinally, the articles highlighted the double standard involved in the situation, with Rice's actions being met with little scrutiny from Democrats compared to the intense coverage of suspected Trump-Russia links. The articles also noted that the Obama administration relaxed rules about sharing intercepted personal communications and the ability to share those with 16 other intelligence agencies.\n\nIn summary, the news outlets reported on new revelations regarding the Obama administration's handling of surveillance during the 2016 presidential election, including former National Security Adviser Susan Rice's requests for the identities of U.S. persons in raw intelligence reports, and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes' knowledge of unmasking and leaking.

Trump critics, meanwhile, say the story doesn't amount to much and accuse the White House of trying to divert attention from the president's wiretapping allegations. A look at coverage: A key story comes from Eli Lake at Bloomberg News. He reported Monday that Rice requested the identities of Trump transition officials who were mentioned, but not named, in US intelligence reports. Those reports were mostly summaries of monitored conversations between foreign officials talking about the Trump transition, but sometimes between Trump associates and foreign officials. (The National Security Council logs of Rice's requests are apparently what Rep. Devin Nunes went to the White House to view.) Lake's piece raises questions about why Rice wanted those names revealed—she didn't respond to the story—but he also notes that her requests \"were likely within the law.\" He adds that the story doesn't \"vindicate\" Trump's unsupported accusation that Obama wiretapped Trump Tower. Adam Housley of Fox News also reported on Rice's requests, and his appearance on the network prompted Trump himself to weigh in via tweet: \"Such amazing reporting on unmasking and the crooked scheme against us by @foxandfriends. 'Spied on before nomination.' The real story.\" A post at Slate notes that Trump associates are under FBI investigation over allegedly improper communications with Russians, \"so there may well have been urgent, legal reasons for Rice to have wanted information about the relationships between specific Trump-related figures and foreign individuals.\" But the editorial page at the Wall Street Journal accuses the media and Democrats of hypocrisy. It wants any Trump-Russia ties investigated, but complains that the \"media have been running like wildebeest after that story while ignoring how the Obama Administration might have abused domestic surveillance for its political purposes. Americans deserve to know the truth about both.\" On CNN, Don Lemon accused the \"right-wing media\" of helping the White House try to divert attention from the controversy over Trump's wiretapping claims, adding that his show will not \"aid and abet people who are trying to misinform you, the American people, by creating a diversion,\" he said, per Mediaite. The conservative NewsBusters blog accused ABC, NBC, and CBS of covering up the story by failing to report on the \"massive revelation\" Monday in their evening broadcasts. On MSNBC Tuesday morning, frequent Trump critic Joe Scarborough blasted the New York Times for not having the story on its front page. \"What is Susan Rice unmasking names for and spreading them across the government,\" he asked on Morning Joe, per Mediaite.

{"pred": " After a freshman died from downing beer, rum, and 151-proof liquor in an initiation ritual, California Polytechnic State University banned fraternities from recruiting newly arrived students. The Interfraternity Conference, which represents 75 national fraternities, opposed the ban and e-mailed and met with Cal Poly administrators. The conference also paid for a study that opposed the ban and spurred a three-year campaign by student leaders. Freshmen deaths related to fraternities account for 40% of the total, with 24 deaths occurring during and after recruiting events. Fraternities have taken steps to protect students, including banning alcohol at recruiting events and supporting sanctions against violators. However, some colleges restrict recruitment for a semester or a year, which could lead to the extension of the delay through sophomore year or even shutting down fraternities. The financial consequences of fraternity membership can be devastating, and they devolve not on the 18-year-old \"man\" but on his planning-for-retirement parents. The opposing positions on this matter are held by Douglas Fierberg, the best plaintiff's attorney in the country when it comes to fraternity-related litigation, and Peter Smithhisler, the CEO of the North-American Interfraternity Conference. Fierberg is a money-hungry lawyer who has chosen to chase the fraternity industry's ambulance, while Smithhisler believes that the fraternity experience at its best constitutes an appeal to a young man's better angels.", "answers": ["Frat-house accidents and sexual assaults are getting so common they're impossible to ignore—but how did it get this bad, and why does it keep happening? In an extensive Atlantic piece, Caitlin Flanagan looks at the history of fraternities and their myriad ways of avoiding legal obligations for what goes on behind closed doors. As Bloomberg reported, 60 students have died in frat-related incidents since 2005, a fact \"that is dwarfed by the numbers of serious injuries, assaults, and sexual crimes that regularly take place in these houses,\" writes Flanagan. She chronicles a few incidents, from a freshman girl's heinous rape at Wesleyan University to a young man who fired a bottle rocket out of his butt at Marshall University—and the guy who fell off a deck videotaping it, and later sued Alpha Tau Omega for his injuries. To avoid financial ruin, fraternities have merged into \"vast national organizations\" that buy liability insurance, and they've created rules about alcohol consumption that are nearly impossible for party-lovers to follow—so when the inevitable lawsuits come, frat members are considered at fault for breaking the rules. That means their soon-to-be-retired parents pay extensive legal bills, and parents' homeowners insurance often pays settlements. So why do universities allow this perilous environment to persist? Largely because fraternity dorms save schools \"untold millions of dollars\" in housing, writes Flanagan, and the frat-house party image helps lure students into expensive universities. To be fair, advocates also describe the positives—like increased confidence, brotherhood, and leadership training.

'Worsened': One of the most cited pieces is from Penn State professor Michael Mann in the Guardian. \"We can't say that Hurricane Harvey was caused by climate change,\" he writes. \"But it was certainly worsened by it.\" The three big factors: Higher ocean levels made the storm surge worse, warmer water made the storm more intense, and Harvey stayed \"locked in place\" thanks to atmospheric changes brought on by humans. (The latter was the subject of a paper by Mann.) Maybe 'slightly': University of Washington atmospheric scientist Cliff Mass is skeptical the link is that strong. \"You really can't pin global warming on something this extreme,\" he tells Fox News. \"It has to be natural variability. It may juice it up slightly but not create this phenomenal anomaly.\" Link is 'unknown': Texas State climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon thinks it's too early to assess any link. \"The climate change impact on the strength of Harvey is unknown,\" he writes to CNN. \"Climate change is expected to increase the intensity of the strongest storms, but it's not clear whether Harvey was in that category.\" Still, he notes that heavier rain in general is a \"direct consequence\" of climate change, and Harvey certainly fits that pattern. Too 'fussy': David Leonhardt at the New York Times thinks \"it's time to shed some of the fussy over-precision about the relationship between climate change and weather.\" The evidence is overwhelming that human-caused climate change results in storms such as Harvey, he writes, and our timidness in admitting it is holding up solutions. All about the rain: The jury is out on whether climate change increases the frequency of hurricanes, writes David Roberts in a wide-ranging Q&A at Vox. But he, too, says it's clear that heavier rain is an undisputed consequence. \"In fact, due to sea level rise and more moisture in the air, I expect flooding to be the most frequent public face of climate change over the next decade or so.\" Media coverage: You won't hear much about climate change in the current news coverage because reporters don't want to \"politicize\" the situation, writes Naomi Klein at the Intercept. \"But here's the thing: Every time we act as if an unprecedented weather event is hitting us out of the blue, as some sort of Act of God that no one foresaw, reporters are making a highly political decision,\" she notes. In contrast, panelists on Fox's The Five spotted a CNN banner mentioning climate change and accused the network of pushing a liberal agenda. \"It's called the weather,\" said co-host Jesse Watters."], "all_classes": null, "length": 11232}

There have been at least a dozen instances of sophisticated foreign hackers gaining remote access to the control systems that run the US electric grid over the past decade. These hackers have the capability to cause widespread blackouts without being detected.\n3. The power grid's aging, outdated systems make it vulnerable to cyber threats. Many substations and equipment are decades old and were never designed with network security in mind, making them easy targets for hackers.\n4. Contractors selling software and equipment to energy companies can also pose a risk to the grid's security.\n5. The rush to tie smart meters, home programmable thermostats, and other smart appliances to the grid is creating fresh vulnerabilities. These devices can be hacked, and their security is flimsy.\n6. The Department of Homeland Security has identified the energy sector as a top priority for cybersecurity, but the full extent of cyber attacks on the grid is not publicly known.\n7. Utilities are unprepared to cope with the threat of cyber attacks, and there are concerns about the lack of standardized guidelines for responding to different types of incidents.\n8.

Over three years, Lance—a Duke grad student with no experience in forensics, no help from experts who'd long been on the case, and no access to the excavated sub itself—carried out what Gizmodo calls an \"exhaustive … analysis\" and finally arrived at a conclusion published in PLOS ONE: that the torpedo created blast waves that pierced the Hunley's hull and instantly killed the eight crew, whose skeletons were found intact during the sub's excavation near Charleston, SC, in 2000. Lance looked at other theories swirling around the Hunley's fate, including low oxygen or a bullet fired by the Housatonic that punctured the sub. She became obsessed, to the point she'd zone out during meals. \"There was something viscerally terrifying about the fact that eight people died that night, and we had no idea how or why,\" she tells Hakai. Her injury biomechanics background finally led her to her shock wave theory. \"When blast waves hit an air space, they slow down like a car hitting a wall,\" she says. \"Except in this case, the wall is the surface of the lungs.\" A mini replica of the Hunley she dubbed the CSS Tiny and a series of test explosions in a rural pond helped her prove her theory, per CNN.

Caitlyn also talks about the physical changes he has gone through, including breast growth and the removal of his beard, and how he has been living in seclusion for the past 25 years. He mentions that he is not doing this for the money and that he has a mortgage on his house and a Porsche that he bought with a birthday gift from his wife, Kris. Caitlyn also talks about the letters he has received from transgender women thanking him for the interview and the dignified way in which ABC and Sawyer handled it.\n\nIn the second passage, it is mentioned that there are an estimated 700,000 transgender women and men in the United States, and that genital surgery is not advised for at least a year after transition. Caitlyn had gone through various stages of transition in the mid- and late 1980s, including taking hormones that resulted in breast growth and having his beard removed through an incredibly painful two-year regimen of electrolysis.

Three sleeve sizes were available, small, medium, and large. And astronauts couldn't fib, explains Rethke.

To make the process a little less embarrassing, the sizes were later renamed: large, gigantic, and humongous.

The plan also includes a $1 trillion infrastructure program, but does not include new funding amounts or a tax mechanism for it. The budget extensively targets Obama programs and investments focused on climate change, seeking to eliminate payments to the United Nations' Green Climate Fund and cut research funding for climate, ocean, and earth science programs.

The budget goes after frequent targets of the party's staunchest conservatives, such as foreign aid and domestic agencies that had been protected by former President Barack Obama. The proposal covers only roughly one-fourth of the approximately $4 trillion federal budget and does not address taxes, Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. The budget is expected to land with a thud on Capitol Hill, with opposition Democrats outraged over cuts to pet programs and Republicans irate over planned elimination of a program to restore the Great Lakes.

Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025.

Scientists expect sea levels to rise between 9.5 inches and 2 feet by 2100—if we stick to the climate treaty agreed upon in Paris. But a high emissions scenario could see seas rise by more than 4 feet. Another study in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences seconds that finding but notes researchers didn't consider the collapse of glaciers of the West Antarctic ice sheet, which \"is hypothesized to be already underway.\" There's no surprise why: Humans burned fossil fuels, which produced greenhouse gases, which melted glaciers and warmed ocean waters, scientists say. If not for humans, sea levels might not have risen at all and thousands of coastal \"nuisance\" floods in the US would have been avoided, according to Climate Central.

For six years, his gambling habit spiraled out of control: He sneaked off to gamble when his wife thought he was working, embezzled nearly $4 million from his firm, and drained his family's savings—until the day in 2012 he decided to end his life. After his suicide, Stacy started researching gambling addiction (she hadn't even known about her husband's problem) and filed suit against the West Virginia casino where he was a regular, as well as the maker of the slot machines there. Experts relay how casinos track and target addicted gamblers, supply ready flows of cash via on-site ATMs, and offer plenty of perks to keep them coming back. But it's the modern-day slot machines themselves, with deceptive technology called virtual reel mapping, that seem to be designed to lull gamblers into a trance—or what the industry refers to as \"continuous gaming productivity\"—so they don't stop playing. While the casinos and machine manufacturers place the blame for gambling addictions on individuals, Terry Noffsinger, the lead attorney for the Stevens suit, says these addictive machines are not due to \"negligence.

Facebook quickly rescinded Khanna's internship offer after he shared the extension. The issue dates back to 2011 when Facebook launched its mobile messaging app with automatic geolocation sharing. Various updates improved usability, but the default setting remained. Khanna used Messenger frequently and realized how much data he unintentionally shared until he began to look at his message history. Facebook's Privacy Incident Response study showed that almost every other message in chats had a location attached to it. The extension scraped location data from messages and created a map showing the sender's location. Khanna found that he could infer a schedule for almost everyone in an active chat and even track the locations of people he was not Facebook friends with. This raises concerns about privacy and the consequences of unintentionally sharing data. Facebook's approach to privacy, as coined by Mark Zuckerberg, is to encourage building quickly and testing boundaries, but Khanna's extension tested those boundaries in a public good by showing users how their data was being used. However, Facebook rescinded Khanna's internship offer, citing that he violated the user agreement when he scraped the site for data.

The flaw was that those locations could be seen by anyone in a group chat, even if the person who sent the message wasn't friends with everyone else in the group. And so Khanna developed a browser app called Marauder's Map that exposed, on a map, the geo-location data that was being shared.

In Pennsylvania, a driver is being sued for wrongful death and negligence after a fatal accident, and two men who texted the driver are also being held liable.

Additionally, a New York bill called the \"textalyzer\" would allow police officers to take phones from drivers after accidents and determine whether they were using the phone in a way that isn't in accordance with state laws.

And in the Pennsylvania case, the judge's ruling didn't hold responsible the two texters who were sending messages to the driver when she crashed into a motorcycle, killing that driver—it was simply determined the texters were fair game for the suit, per the Legal Intelligencer. But the fact that holding non-driving texters liable for car crashes is even being considered is starting to slowly impact the legal landscape on distracted driving. The New Jersey and Pennsylvania cases underscore the challenges in such cases. For instance, it's not enough to hold a texter liable simply because he or she texted a driver: Certain conditions must be met, such as knowing (or having good reason to believe) the driver would pick up the phone to check out texts while driving, as well as proving a \"special relationship\" exists between texter and recipient to influence the recipient picking up. But these kinds of cases, as well as other proposed crackdowns on car texters (including New York's controversial \"textalyzer\" bill), show the issue is being given heavier weight. \"People often see distracted driving as a socially acceptable sin … an innocuous guilty pleasure in which everyone indulges,\" a University of South Carolina law professor tells Vocativ. \"The same used to be true of drunk driving ...
