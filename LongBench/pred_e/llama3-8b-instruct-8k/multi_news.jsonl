However, many parents and children reported that the toy did not hatch, and some even claimed that it was defective.\n\nA California mom, Jodie Hejduk, has filed a class-action lawsuit against Spin Master, the company that manufactures Hatchimals, alleging that the toy was defective and did not hatch as promised.

The experts, who examined the wreck, found artefacts that were not consistent with the Santa Maria, including copper alloy fixations, whereas the Santa Maria should have had iron and/or wood fixations. The team also concluded that the site where the wreck was found is not in the right location, as it is further away from shore than expected.\n\nThe news also reports on the controversy surrounding the discovery, with some experts disagreeing with Unesco's conclusions. A US marine archaeologist, Barry Clifford, had initially believed that he had found the wreck of the Santa Maria, and had announced his findings in May.

Markham was arrested and charged with child neglect. She was later bonded out of jail.\n\nIn a recent development, a judge has ruled that Markham will regain custody of her son, Caleb, with the provision that she provide a nutritionist's report within 10 days. The judge also threw out the claim by Seminole County Child Protective Services that Markham was not fit to care for the child.

This is the first time in the United States that such an apparition has been officially validated. The apparitions occurred in 1859 when a Belgian immigrant named Adele Brise said she was visited three times by Mary, who instructed her to teach Catholic beliefs to children. The church has a long history of investigating such claims, and a two-year investigation by theologians found no evidence of fraud or heresy. The bishop of Green Bay, David L. Ricken, declared that the apparitions were \"worthy of belief\" and that Adele Brise did indeed have encounters of a supernatural character. The shrine has become a popular destination for pilgrims, with many reporting feelings of peace and spiritual renewal. The validation of the apparitions is seen as a source of hope and healing for the Catholic Church, which has been troubled by revelations of sex abuse. The shrine's grounds and the crowd who gathered there were spared the flames of the Great Peshtigo Fire of 1871, which devoured the surrounding lands and homes and caused more than 1,200 deaths. The church's validation of the apparitions is seen as a reminder that God's love is available to all, regardless of their background or circumstances. The shrine is now open to visitors, and many are flocking to the site to pray and pay homage to the Virgin Mary. The validation of the apparitions is a significant event for the Catholic Church and is seen as a source of joy and hope for believers.

The inclusion of Fassbender's David, from 2012's Prometheus, was an incredibly smart move, writes Joe Morgenstern at the Wall Street Journal. But there was little else that impressed him.

Camp had asked the complainant why she didn't keep her knees together and made comments that were perceived as victim-blaming. The Canadian Judicial Council (CJC) found that Camp's conduct was \"so manifestly and profoundly destructive of the concept of impartiality, integrity and independence of the judicial role that public confidence is sufficiently undermined to render the judge incapable of executing the judicial office.\" Camp had apologized for his comments and underwent counseling and additional training on sexual assault laws, but the CJC deemed it insufficient to maintain public confidence.\n\nThe resignation comes after a lengthy process, during which Camp fought to keep his job. He had asked to speak directly to the CJC, but was denied. The CJC's decision was unanimous, with four dissenting judges who believed Camp should not be removed.\n\nThe case has sparked controversy and raised questions about how judges handle sexual assault cases. The Canadian government has introduced legislation to require better training for judges in handling sexual assault cases, and the justice minister has expressed support for the bill.\n\nThe resignation of Justice Camp is seen as a \"watershed moment\" in how courts treat sexual assault, with some experts calling for mandatory judicial training on gendered issues such as sexual assault, domestic violence, and sexual harassment. The case has also highlighted the need for greater accountability within the judiciary.\n\nIn related news, a judge in Nova Scotia acquitted a taxi driver of sexual assault, saying \"a drunk can consent.\" The ruling is under appeal, and the case has sparked outrage and calls for greater awareness and education on sexual assault.\n\nOverall, the resignation of Justice Camp is a significant development in the ongoing conversation about sexual assault and the role of judges in handling these cases.

{"pred": "The discovery of a stone tool at the Rimrock Draw Rockshelter in eastern Oregon has the potential to be the oldest known human occupation in western North America. The tool, a hand-held scraper chipped from a piece of orange agate, was found about 8 inches below a layer of volcanic ash from an eruption of Mount St. Helens that has been dated to 15,800 years ago. The depth was about 12 feet below the surface. If the age of the site holds up to scrutiny, it would be the oldest west of the Rockies, and another predating the so-called Clovis culture, once generally believed to be the first people to migrate from Asia into North America. The earliest Clovis artifacts, known for distinctive and elegant stone points, are dated to about 13,000 years ago. The find has been announced by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, which controls the land on which the site was found. The University of Oregon archaeologist Patrick O'Grady, who supervises the dig, says the Rimrock Draw Rockshelter outside Riley has not been fully excavated. The site has been excavated since 2011, and archaeologists have found a number of stone projectile points and tooth enamel fragments likely belonging to a prehistoric camel. The blood residue analysis of the tool revealed animal proteins consistent with bison, the most likely species being Bison antiquus, an extinct ancestor of the modern buffalo. The discovery of this tool below a layer of undisturbed ash that dates to 15,800 years old means that this tool is likely more than 15,800 years old, which would suggest the oldest human occupation west of the Rockies. The University of Oregon Archaeological Field School, in partnership with the BLM and volunteers from the Oregon Archaeological Society, will begin its fifth season this summer, offering students, researchers and volunteers invaluable field experience. The potential this discovery has for the archaeological community is significant, as it could challenge the current understanding of the first humans in the western hemisphere. The discovery will be scrutinized by researchers, and the team plans to expand their excavation this summer to provide further evidence of artifacts found consistently underneath that layer of volcanic ash.

{"pred": "The Pacific sardine fishery is facing a severe population decline, which has significant implications for the West Coast ecosystem. The Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) is responsible for managing fishing in federal waters off California, Oregon, and Washington, and it is urged to set conservative catch limits on sardines when the population is low and fulfill its commitment to prohibit unregulated fishing on forage fish species. The decline of sardines is likely to have a ripple effect throughout the ecosystem, starving brown pelicans, sea lions, and other predators that rely on them for food. The reasons for the decline are unclear, but scientists point to a naturally occurring climate cycle known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which has brought cold, nutrient-rich water to the West Coast. The decline has prompted steep cuts in the amount fishermen are allowed to catch, and some environmental groups are calling for a halt to fishing altogether. The Pacific sardine is a boom-bust fish, with its numbers fluctuating wildly in response to natural shifts in the ocean environment. The collapse of the sardine fishery in the mid-20th century is a cautionary tale, and scientists are working to understand the causes of the current decline to prevent a similar collapse. The decline of sardines is also having an impact on ocean predators, with some species, such as sea lions, showing signs of malnutrition. Overall, the decline of the Pacific sardine fishery is a significant concern for the West Coast ecosystem and highlights the need for sustainable fishing practices and conservation efforts.

One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans—which also depend on sardines for food—are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)—and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same. Scientists now, as then, aren't sure how to divide the blame between ocean conditions (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a climate cycle, has brought cold, sardine-unfriendly water to the area) and overfishing.

The study also found that only 1 in 5 vegetarians and vegans maintain their diet, with 84% eventually reverting back to eating meat or other animal products.\n\nThe study identified several factors that contribute to people lapsing from a vegetarian or vegan diet, including transitioning to the diet too quickly, not being involved socially with other vegans, and not being able to address certain food cravings.

The investigation began when a deputy in Michigan found multiple tubs of undelivered mail in a ravine in February 2017. The mail was tracked back to the LaPorte Post Office and Block's assigned routes. Block admitted to paying a friend $50 to burn mail he didn't have time to deliver on a \"regular basis.\" He also hid about 6,000 pieces of mail at his home. Block resigned from his job at the post office in February 2017 and is now facing charges of felony official misconduct and misdemeanor theft. A warrant has been issued for his arrest.

{"pred": "The news highlights the importance of reducing antibiotic use in outpatient settings. According to a study published in JAMA, nearly a third of antibiotics prescribed in doctors' offices, emergency rooms, and hospital-based clinics in the United States are not needed. This translates to about 47 million unnecessary prescriptions given out each year. The study found that most of these prescriptions are for conditions that don't respond to antibiotics, such as colds, sore throats, bronchitis, flu, and other viral illnesses.\n\nThe study analyzed data from two major CDC surveys from 2010 to 2011 and found that about 13 percent of all outpatient visits in the United States result in an antibiotic prescription. Additionally, more than four in 10 (44 percent) of antibiotic prescriptions are written to treat patients with acute respiratory conditions, such as sinus infections, middle ear infections, sore throats, colds, bronchitis, asthma, allergies, flu, and pneumonia. Half of these prescriptions are unnecessary because many are for viral illnesses.\n\nThe study's lead author, Katherine Fleming-Dutra, a CDC medical epidemiologist, noted that doctors often prescribe antibiotics because of pressure from patients or parents. However, better communication by doctors about the dangers of antibiotic overuse can lead to more appropriate prescribing.\n\nThe overuse of antibiotics has led to the rise of drug-resistant superbugs, and the CDC has warned that \"nightmare bacteria\" are increasingly resistant to even the strongest antibiotics. The White House has set a target of reducing inappropriate antibiotic use in outpatient settings by half by 2020.\n\nBased on the study's findings, this goal would be reached by cutting outpatient antibiotic use by 15 percent overall, which would result in approximately 23 million fewer antibiotics prescribed annually by 2020. The study's authors emphasized the importance of reducing antibiotic use to prevent the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and to preserve the effectiveness of these life-saving drugs.\n\nOverall, the news highlights the need for healthcare providers, patients, and policymakers to work together to reduce antibiotic use and promote appropriate prescribing practices. By doing so, we can help prevent the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and ensure that antibiotics remain effective in treating life-threatening infections.", "answers": ["Scientists have been concerned for some time about \"Phantom Menace\"-type superbugs that aren't fazed by meds. The latest CDC data finds that 2 million people a year in the US are infected with bacteria resistant to antibiotics, and at least 23,000 die directly from those infections. And a new report from the CDC and the Pew Charitable Trusts—the first research to quantify this issue, per the Washington Post—isn't encouraging. A study published Tuesday in JAMA finds nearly one in three antibiotic prescriptions (around 47 million per year) are given needlessly to people with viruses such as bronchitis and the common cold, as well as for ear and sinus infections and sore throats not caused by bacterial infections—meaning the Rx not only won't vanquish their illness, but can potentially build up antibiotic resistance, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Besides the drug resistance, overuse can up the risk for drug allergies and even an unpleasant-sounding diarrhea that can be fatal. The researchers analyzed 184,032 outpatient visits to ERs and medical clinics in 2010 and 2011 and found that 12.6% walked out with an antibiotic script, per the Pharmacy Times. Out of an estimated annual antibiotic-prescription rate of 506 per every 1,000 people, only about 353 of those who received prescriptions should likely have received them. The Times notes President Obama's initiative to cut down on unnecessary outpatient antibiotic use by 50% by 2020; researchers say that, based on this study, we'll need to slash overall antibiotic use by 15% to meet that. \"If we continue down the road of inappropriate use we'll lose the most powerful tool we have to fight life-threatening infections,\" CDC Director Tom Frieden says. \"Losing these antibiotics would undermine our ability to treat patients with deadly infections [and] cancer, provide organ transplants, and save victims of burns and trauma.\" (Here's hoping teixobactin can help us out with superbugs.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3153}

He also allegedly used his law office as a \"money laundering conduit\" to conceal the payments, labeling them as legal referral fees and consulting fees for working on real estate issues.\n\nJoyce is accused of participating in several complex schemes, including one in which he extorted a Jeep from a Milton developer and another in which he collected phony legal fees from a Dunkin' Donuts store owner. He is also accused of using his position to exert influence on behalf of a New York-based energy brokerage business and a Philadelphia-based solar company.\n\nThe indictment alleges that Joyce created a shell company to launder the proceeds from his bribery and kickback schemes and that he lied to the state's ethics commission and used the panel as a \"cloak of legitimacy\" for his corrupt activities.\n\nJoyce's attorney, Howard Cooper, has denied any wrongdoing and suggested that the charges are the result of overzealous federal prosecutors. However, the indictment paints a picture of a politician who used his office for personal gain and who was willing to engage in illegal activities to achieve his goals.\n\nThe arrest and indictment of Joyce are the latest in a series of corruption scandals to rock the Massachusetts State House. In recent years, several other politicians have been charged with corruption-related crimes, including former House Speaker Sal DiMasi and former state Sen. Dianne Wilkerson.\n\nThe case against Joyce is expected to be a major test of the state's anti-corruption laws and the ability of law enforcement to hold public officials accountable for their actions. The indictment has sparked widespread outrage and calls for reform, with many calling for greater transparency and accountability in government.

The study also found that west-facing panels reduced peak energy usage by 65%, while south-facing panels reduced it by 54%.\n\nThe study's findings have significant implications for the residential solar market.

That finding stems from an analysis of 15,632 women who participated in the Nurses' Health Study II over a 10-year period beginning in 1991. A press release explains the women had not previously had gestational diabetes, and at four-year intervals answered questions related to their diet in the year prior. Under the potato category, they were asked to rate their consumption of baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes, fries, or potato chips on a scale of \"never\" to \"six or more times a day.\" The researchers begin their study by noting just how prevalent potato consumption is, with 35% of American women ages 19-50 eating potatoes daily, and the vegetable accounting for 8% of their caloric intake.

The researchers used a thermal desorber combined with a gas chromatograph coupled to mass spectrometry to identify the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) released during decomposition.

The melt rate increased from 1992 to 2011, and then again from 2012 to 2017. The study, published in the journal Nature, is the second of assessments planned every several years by a team of scientists working with NASA and the European Space Agency.\n\nThe study found that part of West Antarctica, where most of the melting occurred, \"is in a state of collapse.\" The team used 24 different methods to measure ice loss, including satellite data, ground and air measurements, and computer simulations. The study's lead author, Andrew Shepherd of the University of Leeds in England, said that it's possible that Antarctica alone can add about half a foot (16 centimeters) to sea level rise by the end of the century.\n\nThe melting of Antarctica is primarily caused by warmer water nibbling at the floating edges of ice sheets from below.

At the heart of the commotion is whether a current president can walk back a former president's creation of a national monument under the Antiquities Act, with Native American tribes, environmental groups, and paleontologists arguing that Trump doesn't have the authority to do so; two legal experts interviewed by the AP had varying opinions on the matter. NBC News, which notes the legal wrangling over the national monuments could stretch out for years, adds that Patagonia has long been active in fighting for Utah's public lands. The AP notes more lawsuits are anticipated, especially if Trump moves on Zinke's push to cut other national monuments.

The much-assailed decision was one made by owner Russell Brice, who had grown fearful of a 900-foot-wide overhang of glacial ice set directly above the main route on the mountain's Nepal side, an overhang that his members were directly under for as long as an hour while traversing the route. As Krakauer writes, the \"wedge of ice the size of a Beverly Hills mansion\" that broke free and caused last week's avalanche came from \"that same ice bulge\" and killed 16 Sherpas. As for the outsize dangers Sherpas face, some standout points: Between 1921 and 1996, the mountain's death ratio was a treacherous one death for every four completed ascents. Between 1997 and present, the death ratio was one for every 60. Among the reasons it's gotten safer: Climbers tend to pack and use more bottled oxygen, and some take the robust steroid dexamethasone once they hit 22,000 feet, which pares down the risk of developing the often fatal high-altitude cerebral edema and high-altitude pulmonary edema. Sherpas typically have less of the former and none of the latter (and are, of course, the ones lugging those extra oxygen bottles up the mountain).

The article is a fascinating oral history of the show's beginning that includes interviews with Stewart, Carell, Stephen Colbert, and pretty much everyone involved. The first year was rough for Stewart as he fought with the holdover writing staff from previous host Craig Kilborn and sought to put his stamp on the show.

After a few seconds of awkward silence, Carell says, \"I was just kidding! I don’t even know what that means!\" And the tense moment subsides. (See the clip.) Carell: \"It was making fun of a gotcha moment.

It is estimated to be orbiting the sun at a distance of billions of miles beyond Neptune's path, and its discovery is expected to be confirmed within the next five years.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine was made possible by the analysis of the motion of small, icy objects in the outer solar system. The researchers used mathematical and computer modeling to identify the gravitational influence of a large, unseen object on the motion of these objects. They believe that this object is Planet Nine, and that it is responsible for the unusual clustering of the small, icy objects in the outer solar system.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine has significant implications for our understanding of the solar system. It suggests that there may be many more large, unseen objects in the outer solar system, and that the solar system may be much more complex than previously thought. The discovery also raises questions about the definition of a planet, and whether Pluto should be considered a planet or not.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine has been met with excitement and controversy. Some scientists are celebrating the discovery as a major breakthrough, while others are questioning the definition of a planet and whether Pluto should be considered a planet or not. The debate is likely to continue for some time, but the discovery of Planet Nine is a significant step forward in our understanding of the solar system.\n\nIn related news, the New Horizons spacecraft has flown by Pluto and has provided new insights into the dwarf planet. The spacecraft has revealed that Pluto has a surface that is much more complex and varied than previously thought, and that it has a thin atmosphere. The discovery of Planet Nine has also renewed calls for Pluto to be reinstated as a planet, but the debate is likely to continue for some time.\n\nOverall, the discovery of Planet Nine is a significant step forward in our understanding of the solar system, and it is likely to have a major impact on our understanding of the solar system and the definition of a planet.

The cost of marketing a movie has increased significantly, making it harder for studios to make a profit on smaller films.\n\nThe major studios are now focusing on big-budget blockbusters, with many films being made for over $100 million. This has led to a decline in the number of mid-budget films being produced, and many filmmakers are turning to television to tell their stories. The TV industry has become more prestigious, with many filmmakers finding success on shows like True Detective and Transparent.\n\nHowever, the TV industry is not without its challenges, with many shows struggling to find an audience and stay on the air. The current model of filmmaking is unsustainable, with many predicting that there will be an implosion in the industry, leading to a change in the way movies are made.\n\nThe article concludes by suggesting that the mid-budget film industry may be on the verge of a collapse, similar to what happened in the 1960s. However, this could also lead to a new era of innovation and creativity in the film industry, as filmmakers are forced to adapt to a changing market.", "answers": ["Wonder what happened to iconic film directors like David Lynch, John Waters, and Francis Ford Coppola?

Paramount's Titanic made that point in 1997 by costing $200 million and earning nearly $2.2 billion worldwide. At that time, mid-budget films like Kiss the Girls and In & Out dominated the Paramount slate and drew modest profits; this year, mega-flicks like Transformers: Age of Extinction, Hercules, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles rule Paramount's roost and earn the big bucks. \"You could make movies in the ten-to-twenty-million-dollar budget range\" at one time, says Susan Seidelman, director of Desperately Seeking Susan. Now, she says, studios \"have to appeal to every demographic in every part of the world.\" And few seasoned directors want to test the indie market, where tons of under-$2 million films are vying for attention. So Spike Lee has funded a film via Kickstarter, Steven Soderbergh publicly quit feature filmmaking last year, and other directors are turning to TV for creative freedom.

The vote is set to take place on Wednesday evening.\n\nIn related news, May has been making last-minute appeals to her lawmakers to support her leadership, saying that a change in leadership would delay or stop Britain's departure from the European Union. She has also been trying to win over lawmakers who are opposed to her Brexit deal, which has been met with criticism from many in the party.\n\nThe vote comes as the UK is set to leave the EU on March 29, and the country is still without a clear plan for its departure. The EU has made it clear that it will not renegotiate the withdrawal agreement, which has been rejected by the UK Parliament.\n\nMany business leaders and economists have expressed alarm about the political uncertainty in the UK, which they say is weighing heavily on the economy.

The Republicans, on the other hand, praised Kavanaugh and expressed confidence that he will be confirmed.\n\nKavanaugh, a veteran judge and former aide to Bush, sat silently as the spectacle unfolded. He delivered a prepared opening statement, in which he emphasized his commitment to being a neutral and impartial arbiter on the Supreme Court. He also praised the importance of the Supreme Court as the last line of defense for the separation of powers and the rights and liberties guaranteed by the Constitution.\n\nThe hearing is expected to continue on Wednesday, with senators questioning Kavanaugh and a panel of legal experts who support and oppose his confirmation. The outcome of the hearing is uncertain, but it is likely to be a contentious and closely watched process.\n\nIn related news, Trump took to Twitter to denounce the Democrats' opposition to Kavanaugh, calling it \"mean, angry, and despicable.\" The president also dismissed the possibility of another prospective candidate, former Secretary of State John Kerry, entering the 2020 presidential race.\n\nThe hearing has also sparked a debate about the role of the Supreme Court in American politics and the importance of the confirmation process. Some have argued that the hearing is a test of the Senate's ability to function and a preview of the 2020 presidential campaign.

Monis, an Iranian refugee, was known to the Australian police for his criminal history, including convictions for sending offensive letters to the families of Australian soldiers killed in Afghanistan and for being an accessory to the murder of his ex-wife. He was also facing multiple sexual and indecent assault charges. On Monday, Monis took 17 people hostage at the Lindt Chocolat Cafe in Martin Place, Sydney, and demanded that the Australian government withdraw its troops from Afghanistan. The siege ended when police stormed the cafe, killing Monis and two hostages. The two hostages who died were identified as cafe manager Tori Johnson and Sydney lawyer Katrina Dawson. Four other people were injured in the siege. The Australian Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, has questioned why Monis was not on the country's terror watch list and has promised to investigate the police operation. The siege has raised concerns about the ability of the authorities to prevent lone-wolf attacks and the need for greater vigilance in the face of global jihadism. The Australian National Imams Council has condemned the attack and urged Australians not to be caught up in \"violence and its cycle of recrimination.\" A church service was held at Sydney's St Mary Cathedral to mourn the victims.

The review comes after The Washington Post reported in April that Justice Department officials had known for years that flawed forensic work might have led to the convictions of potentially innocent people but had not performed a thorough review of the cases.\n\nThe review has found that nearly every examiner in the FBI's microscopic hair comparison unit gave flawed testimony in almost all trials in which they offered evidence against criminal defendants over more than a two-decade period before 2000.

The movie, based on the beloved children's book by Roald Dahl, has failed to impress audiences, earning only $22 million over the July 4th holiday weekend. This is a significant disappointment, as the film had a budget of $140 million and was expected to perform well. The movie's poor performance has led to speculation that Spielberg's box office magic may be waning.\n\nSeveral factors have been cited as contributing to the film's poor performance. One is the lack of awareness about the book among modern families, which may have made it difficult for audiences to connect with the story. Another is the film's confusing title, which may have turned off some viewers. Additionally, the film's lack of big-name stars may have made it harder to attract a large audience.\n\nThe news has also sparked debate about the future of Spielberg's career. Some have suggested that the director's reliance on prestige films may have contributed to the film's poor performance, as audiences may not be as interested in serious dramas as they once were. Others have noted that Spielberg's last big commercial success was Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, which was released in 2008.\n\nDespite the poor performance of The BFG, Spielberg remains one of the most successful directors in Hollywood, with a long history of making successful films. His next project, Ready Player One, is expected to perform well, as it is based on a popular novel and has a built-in audience.\n\nOverall, the news this week highlights the challenges facing Hollywood studios in today's competitive market. With the rise of streaming services and changing audience preferences, it can be difficult for films to connect with audiences and achieve commercial success. The poor performance of The BFG serves as a reminder of the importance of understanding audience preferences and adapting to changing market trends.", "answers": ["With a $140 million budget and an opening weekend take of only $24 million, The BFG is poised to be Steven Spielberg's biggest flop in 37 years, Rolling Stone reports. That's left people wondering if the man who essentially invented the summer blockbuster with Jaws has lost his summertime feeling. Here's what some of the experts are saying: Slash Film argues you can't blame Spielberg for the failure, as he's far from the first director to flop when adapting a story by Roald Dahl. In fact, only one film based on a Dahl book—Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory—has made more than $34 million in US theaters. The Wrap has a list of seven reasons The BFG bombed, from \"Roald Dahl is no JK Rowling\" to a lack of stars and a confusing title. The BFG might be proof it's time for Spielberg to step away from family films, according to the Hollywood Reporter, which points out the director hasn't had a hit family film since Hook a quarter of a century ago. He's had better luck with recent grown-up fare like Lincoln and Bridge of Spies. The Wall Street Journal details Spielberg's history of being able to \"bounce back\" after cinematic disappointments, something he should have a good chance of doing with his next three films currently including a historical drama, a science-fiction movie based on a popular book, and an Indiana Jones sequel. But the \"reason this stings\" is because every other time Spielberg disappointed at the box office, it was with a \"good for you\" film, according to Forbes. Whereas The BFG was intended as a money-maker for the studio. Finally, Movie Pilot argues that the failure of The BFG shouldn't count against any future Spielberg or Dahl movies. \"The main issue of the movie is more about being unremarkable than disastrous.”"], "all_classes": null, "length": 4655}

The article cites a study that found that 2.2% of abortion patients had attempted to induce their own abortions, and another study that estimated that 4.1% of Texas women had attempted to self-induce. The article also notes that the rise of online searches for self-abortion information and the availability of abortion pills online have made it easier for women to take matters into their own hands. However, the article also highlights the risks and complications associated with self-induced abortion, including the risk of infection, bleeding, and incomplete abortion. The article concludes by noting that while some advocates argue that making abortion pills available to women at home could increase access to safe and legal abortion, others argue that this approach could lead to more harm than good.\n\nThe second article provides a personal account of a woman who sought to end her pregnancy on her own after being unable to afford an abortion at a clinic. The article highlights the challenges and risks associated with self-induced abortion, including the risk of complications and the emotional toll of the experience. The article also notes that many women who seek to self-induce are motivated by a desire to avoid the stigma and shame associated with seeking an abortion at a clinic.\n\nThe third article provides information on the use of misoprostol, a medication that can be used to induce abortion, and the risks and complications associated with its use. The article notes that misoprostol is approved by the World Health Organization as a safe abortion method when used by women themselves, but that it should only be used under the guidance of a medical provider. The article also provides information on how to use misoprostol safely and effectively, including the importance of following the correct dosage and administration instructions.\n\nOverall, the news articles highlight the complex and controversial issue of self-induced abortion, and the need for greater access to safe and legal abortion services.

A look at coverage: A key story comes from Eli Lake at Bloomberg News.

Those reports were mostly summaries of monitored conversations between foreign officials talking about the Trump transition, but sometimes between Trump associates and foreign officials.

The practice was introduced carefully and incrementally, and participants were asked to keep their involvement confidential, anticipating a time when husbands and wives could acknowledge one another publicly.\n\nThe practice of plural marriage was not without its challenges. It was a trial of faith for many who practiced it, and it provoked controversy and opposition. The Church's leaders and members experienced difficulties as they heeded the command to practice plural marriage and later as they worked to discontinue it after Church President Wilford Woodruff issued an inspired statement known as the Manifesto in 1890, which led to the end of plural marriage in the Church.\n\nThe Church acknowledges that the introduction of plural marriage was a difficult and challenging process. Many women and men who participated in the practice risked reputation and self-respect, and some faced opposition and persecution. However, for many, the experience was also one of spiritual growth and refinement.\n\nToday, the Church no longer practices plural marriage, but it continues to honor the faithful pioneers who gave so much for their faith, families, and community. The Church also permits a man whose wife has died to be sealed to another woman when he remarries, and it allows members to perform ordinances on behalf of deceased men and women who married more than once on earth, sealing them to all of the spouses to whom they were legally married. Ultimately, the Church encourages its members to trust in their wise Heavenly Father, who loves His children and does all things for their growth and salvation.", "answers": ["The Mormon church's big revelations didn't stop with its sacred undergarments: In an online essay titled \"Plural Marriage in Kirtland and Nauvoo,\" the church for the first time declares that founder Joseph Smith was a polygamist, with a footnote stating that \"careful estimates\" put his tally of wives at between 30 and 40. The essay explains that Smith was ordered to take multiple wives by an angel who visited him three times between 1834 and 1842; in the last instance, the angel was armed with a sword and threatened a reluctant Smith. The leader, then married to first wife Emma, took his first plural wife, Fanny Alger, in Kirtland, Ohio. Smith and Alger ultimately separated, and the church relocated to Nauvoo, Ill., where he married many more women. The oldest was 56, and the youngest was 14-year-old Helen Mar Kimball; some were already married, a revelation the New York Times describes as the \"biggest bombshell for some.\" The essay explains that a number of marriages, including that with Kimball, were sealed \"for eternity alone,\" suggesting sexual relations weren't involved (the ones that did involve sex were \"for time and eternity\"). What did Emma think of all this? Per the essay, she was none too pleased, though at one time she did accept four of Smith's wives into their home. And what was the reasoning behind what the essay describes as the \"wrenching trial\" of polygamy? Kimball said Smith told her that \"the practice of this principle would be the hardest trial the Saints would ever have to test their faith.\" Two more essays discuss plural marriage in the church's later years; they're part of an effort the church is making to share \"reliable, faith-promoting\" info about its past, the church's historian tells the Times.

The study, conducted by researchers Michael Kasumovic and Jeffrey Kuznekoff, used an online first-person shooter game, Halo 3, to examine how male players behave towards female-voiced teammates. The results showed that lower-skilled and poorer-performing males were more hostile towards female-voiced teammates, while higher-skilled males were more positive.

She chronicles a few incidents, from a freshman girl's heinous rape at Wesleyan University to a young man who fired a bottle rocket out of his butt at Marshall University—and the guy who fell off a deck videotaping it, and later sued Alpha Tau Omega for his injuries. To avoid financial ruin, fraternities have merged into \"vast national organizations\" that buy liability insurance, and they've created rules about alcohol consumption that are nearly impossible for party-lovers to follow—so when the inevitable lawsuits come, frat members are considered at fault for breaking the rules. That means their soon-to-be-retired parents pay extensive legal bills, and parents' homeowners insurance often pays settlements. So why do universities allow this perilous environment to persist? Largely because fraternity dorms save schools \"untold millions of dollars\" in housing, writes Flanagan, and the frat-house party image helps lure students into expensive universities.

The girl was intoxicated and unable to consent, and the boys were charged with rape and kidnapping.

Australian police seem to be believers: They raided Wright's home in Sydney on Wednesday, reports the New York Times.

As with most debates on climate change—particularly when talking about a single weather event—the views are all over the map. And some are suggesting that we need to frame the question differently to get the most accurate response. The details: Wrong question: Did climate change cause Harvey? That's not the right question, writes Dino Grandoni at the Washington Post. \"The better way to frame thinking about the connection is through the question: Does climate change make storms like Harvey more likely?\" This is a theme repeated in multiple posts on the subject, and Grandoni thinks the answer is yes, for reasons spelled out below. 'Worsened': One of the most cited pieces is from Penn State professor Michael Mann in the Guardian. \"We can't say that Hurricane Harvey was caused by climate change,\" he writes. \"But it was certainly worsened by it.\" The three big factors: Higher ocean levels made the storm surge worse, warmer water made the storm more intense, and Harvey stayed \"locked in place\" thanks to atmospheric changes brought on by humans. (The latter was the subject of a paper by Mann.) Maybe 'slightly': University of Washington atmospheric scientist Cliff Mass is skeptical the link is that strong. \"You really can't pin global warming on something this extreme,\" he tells Fox News. \"It has to be natural variability. It may juice it up slightly but not create this phenomenal anomaly.\" Link is 'unknown': Texas State climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon thinks it's too early to assess any link. \"The climate change impact on the strength of Harvey is unknown,\" he writes to CNN. \"Climate change is expected to increase the intensity of the strongest storms, but it's not clear whether Harvey was in that category.\" Still, he notes that heavier rain in general is a \"direct consequence\" of climate change, and Harvey certainly fits that pattern. Too 'fussy': David Leonhardt at the New York Times thinks \"it's time to shed some of the fussy over-precision about the relationship between climate change and weather.\" The evidence is overwhelming that human-caused climate change results in storms such as Harvey, he writes, and our timidness in admitting it is holding up solutions. All about the rain: The jury is out on whether climate change increases the frequency of hurricanes, writes David Roberts in a wide-ranging Q&A at Vox. But he, too, says it's clear that heavier rain is an undisputed consequence. \"In fact, due to sea level rise and more moisture in the air, I expect flooding to be the most frequent public face of climate change over the next decade or so.\" Media coverage: You won't hear much about climate change in the current news coverage because reporters don't want to \"politicize\" the situation, writes Naomi Klein at the Intercept. \"But here's the thing: Every time we act as if an unprecedented weather event is hitting us out of the blue, as some sort of Act of God that no one foresaw, reporters are making a highly political decision,\" she notes.

Booker called his act one of civil disobedience, reports NPR. \"I openly invite and accept the consequences,\" he said, per CNN. \"The penalty comes with potential ousting from the Senate.\" Indeed, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn read aloud rules stating that a senator who divulges \"the secret or confidential business\" of the Senate faces expulsion, reports the Washington Post. \"Bring the charges,\" said Booker. \"All of us are ready to face that rule,\" added fellow Democrat Richard Blumenthal. Democrats have been chafing that too many of Kavanaugh's documents are either being withheld or deemed off limits for the hearing. Booker's stand comes after the New York Times obtained some of those off-limits emails. In one from 2003, when Kavanaugh was working in the White House of George W. Bush, he objects to language that Roe v. Wade is \"settled law.\" He was going over a draft opinion stating that \"it is widely accepted by legal scholars across the board that Roe v. Wade and its progeny are the settled law of the land,\" but he took exception to the phrase. \"I am not sure that all legal scholars refer to Roe as the settled law of the land at the Supreme Court level since Court can always overrule its precedent, and three current Justices on the Court would do so,\" he wrote at the time.

The Obama White House released seven prisoners it characterized as non-dangerous businessmen, neglecting to mention that three of them had been deemed a threat to national security by the president's own Justice Department. (They'd been accused of illegally shipping US macroelectronics to Tehran for use in surface-to-air and cruise missiles.) What's more, Politico found that the US also quietly dropped criminal cases against 14 fugitives, including Seyed Abolfazl Shahab Jamili, who allegedly procured thousands of parts with nuclear applications for Iran by way of China. \"They didn’t just dismiss a bunch of innocent business guys,\" one former federal law enforcement supervisor tells Politico. \"And then they didn’t give a full story of it.\" In fact, Meyer writes, the White House actions \"derailed\" its own successful investigations into Iran's proliferation network, angering Justice Department prosecutors.

CLIS is a condition caused by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) that leaves patients paralyzed but still aware and able to think. The technology uses functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to detect patterns in brain activity and answer \"yes\" or \"no\" questions. Four patients, aged 24 to 76, were trained to use the system and were able to answer questions about their quality of life. Surprisingly, all four patients reported being \"happy\" with their lives, suggesting that CLIS may not be the living hell many presume it to be. The study's findings were published in the journal Plos Biology and have the potential to transform the lives of patients with CLIS. The technology could also be used to communicate with other brain-injured patients, including those who are presumed to be in a vegetative state. The study's lead researcher, Niels Birbaumer, plans to build a system that allows patients to communicate more proactively, rather than simply answering questions. The findings of this study suggest that fNIRS may be a reliable and cost-effective means of communicating with patients who are entirely physically non-responsive.

In other words, they had \"locked-in syndrome,\" meaning total motor paralysis in spite of normal cognitive and emotional processing. Researchers at the University of Tübingen in Germany fitted the patients with caps through which they could observe changes in blood flow in different parts of the brain, they explain in the journal PLOS Biology. They first asked the patients to think yes or no in response to simple statements such as their spouse's name, and moved on to more personal questions when that was mastered. “It’s the first sign that completely locked-in syndrome may be abolished forever, because with all of these patients, we can now ask them the most critical questions in life,” says researcher Niels Birbaumer. The patients, all of whom are on ventilators and being cared for at home, range in age from 24 to 76. The team did stumble on a couple surprises. For instance, all four patients suggested they were \"happy\" with their lives in spite of being locked-in. (Birmbaumer suggests this might be because of something akin to meditation.) And one patient, who is 61, answered \"no\" nine times out of 10 when his 26-year-old daughter asked if she should marry her boyfriend Mario. \"But they got married,\" one of the researchers tells the BBC. \"Nothing can come between love.\" (Researchers can't explain how Stephen Hawking has lived this long.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 9424}

The budget calls for a $54 billion increase in defense spending, the largest since President Ronald Reagan's Pentagon buildup in the 1980s. The increase is financed by $54 billion in cuts to foreign aid and domestic agencies that had been protected by former President Barack Obama. The budget also proposes significant cuts to several government agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Department of Agriculture, Labor, State, and the National Institutes of Health. The EPA would lose over 3,000 jobs and programs such as Obama's Clean Power Plan would be eliminated. The budget also proposes cuts to renewable energy, climate change research, and rehabilitation of housing projects.\n\nThe budget is expected to face significant opposition from both Democrats and Republicans in Congress. Democrats are likely to oppose the cuts to domestic programs and the increase in defense spending, while Republicans may oppose the cuts to foreign aid and the elimination of programs such as the National Endowment for the Arts.\n\nThe budget is part of Trump's \"America First\" agenda, which aims to prioritize the interests of the United States over those of other countries. The budget is expected to be released on Thursday and will be followed by a series of budget hearings in Congress.\n\nIn related news, Trump has also proposed a $1.4 billion infusion in the ongoing fiscal year for the border wall, with another $2.6 billion planned for the 2018 budget year.

The Environmental Protection Agency and the State Department are the hardest-hit agencies according to budget previews, with cuts of around 30%.

The crew of eight never returned, and the mystery of their deaths has lasted for over 130 years. A new study by biomechanist Rachel Lance suggests that the crew died instantly from the shockwave triggered by their own torpedo explosion. The study, published in PLoS One, found that the explosion caused minimal damage to the sub, but the ensuing shockwave caused catastrophic injuries to the crewmen's soft tissues, especially their lungs and brains. The findings were based on experiments using a scale model of the sub and black powder explosions. The study's conclusions contradict previous theories that the crew died from suffocation or a lucky shot from the enemy ship. The Hunley Project, a team of researchers and scientists at Clemson University, has been studying the sub for 17 years and has not found any conclusive evidence to explain the loss of the submarine. The team has acknowledged the explosion theory as a possibility but has doubts about the findings. The mystery of the Hunley's fate remains unsolved, and further research is needed to confirm the study's conclusions.

Over three years, Lance—a Duke grad student with no experience in forensics, no help from experts who'd long been on the case, and no access to the excavated sub itself—carried out what Gizmodo calls an \"exhaustive … analysis\" and finally arrived at a conclusion published in PLOS ONE: that the torpedo created blast waves that pierced the Hunley's hull and instantly killed the eight crew, whose skeletons were found intact during the sub's excavation near Charleston, SC, in 2000. Lance looked at other theories swirling around the Hunley's fate, including low oxygen or a bullet fired by the Housatonic that punctured the sub.

One key part missing: details on how to pay for it, though Sanders plans to release a separate paper on that, reports the Wall Street Journal.

Co-payments would go away, and people would pay premiums based on their incomes, reports the AP. Private insurers would still exist, but for things such as elective plastic surgery or, sometimes, to act as middlemen between the government and hospitals or doctors.

In short, it \"describes a system in which only one entity—the government—pays medical bills. If all Americans had Medicare rather than insurance through their jobs, it would be a single-payer system.\" Vox says Sanders' system is far more generous than single-payer plans in Canada and elsewhere. The cost: This could cost hundreds of billions of dollars more per year, per the Journal. Details are yet to come, but Sanders envisions a progressive tax increase, with the wealthy paying more income, capital gains, and estate taxes, reports Newsweek.

{"pred": " \n\nThe Nobel Prize in Literature has been awarded to Bob Dylan, but the celebration has been marred by allegations of plagiarism. A journalist, Andrea Pitzer, has accused Dylan of using SparkNotes, a study guide, as a source for his Nobel lecture. Pitzer claims that 20 passages from SparkNotes' summary of Herman Melville's \"Moby-Dick\" appear in Dylan's lecture with similar wording. This is not the first time Dylan has been accused of plagiarism, as he has been accused of lifting passages from various poets and novelists for his song lyrics. In a 2012 interview, Dylan defended his use of quotation, saying that it is a rich and enriching tradition in folk and jazz. However, some critics argue that Dylan's use of SparkNotes is different from the folk process and is instead a shortcut. Despite the allegations, many cultural critics and music professors do not see the plagiarism as detracting from the value of the lecture. One professor even joked that rescinding Dylan's Nobel Prize would be \"historic.\" The Swedish Academy has not commented on the allegations, but it is unlikely that they will rescind the prize. Overall, the controversy surrounding Dylan's Nobel lecture has sparked a debate about the use of quotation and the boundaries of artistic expression.

She says at least 20 of the 78 sentences involved strongly resemble SparkNotes passages and compares several of them side by side.

However, the campaign underestimated the threat posed by Donald Trump, who emerged as a formidable opponent and eventually became the front-runner.

The campaign's failure was attributed to a combination of factors, including Bush's inability to connect with voters, his lack of energy, and the campaign's failure to adapt to the changing political landscape. The campaign's reliance on a super PAC and its failure to engage with voters on social media also contributed to its downfall. In the end, Bush's campaign was seen as a misread of the electorate and a misunderstanding of the modern media environment.

The brutal killings of Heather Aldrich, her sister Carrie Nelson, and Nelson's boyfriend Jody Hutchinson—all of whom were reportedly asphyxiated—and the discovery of their bodies in a burned-out SUV in the woods was linked back to Aldrich's relationship with Kenneth Brunke, who police and locals say was a gun-happy Manistique drug dealer, and his friend Garry Cordell, who tried to tell Brunke that Aldrich, the object of Brunke's affections, was using him for drugs. And Aldrich did steal a cocaine stash from Brunke's yard, which was followed by a text from Brunke ostensibly meant to lure Aldrich to come over for some free morphine. Aldrich headed to Brunke's house, along with Nelson and Hutchinson, which is where the story takes a weird turn. At first Cordell and his girlfriend, Marietta Carlson, confessed they and Brunke had killed the victims, though the stories kept changing; Brunke denied participating.

In Pennsylvania, a judge ruled that two men who texted a driver at the time of a fatal accident could be held liable for the accident, setting a precedent for third-party texters to be held accountable. This decision follows a 2013 New Jersey appellate ruling that established that third parties who are aware they are texting a distracted driver can be liable for the driver's accidents. The news also reports on a recent case in New York where an Uber driver is suing Snapchat for \"motivating\" a driver to drive recklessly, resulting in a serious accident. Additionally, lawmakers in New York are proposing a \"textalyzer\" bill that would allow police officers to take phones from drivers after accidents and determine whether they were using the phone in a way that isn't in accordance with state laws. The bill also proposes that drivers would be forced to hand over their phone after a wreck or risk a driver's license suspension. While some have raised concerns about the privacy implications of the textalyzer bill, experts believe that it could help reduce texting-related accidents and change the way society views distracted driving.

And in the Pennsylvania case, the judge's ruling didn't hold responsible the two texters who were sending messages to the driver when she crashed into a motorcycle, killing that driver—it was simply determined the texters were fair game for the suit, per the Legal Intelligencer. But the fact that holding non-driving texters liable for car crashes is even being considered is starting to slowly impact the legal landscape on distracted driving. The New Jersey and Pennsylvania cases underscore the challenges in such cases. For instance, it's not enough to hold a texter liable simply because he or she texted a driver: Certain conditions must be met, such as knowing (or having good reason to believe) the driver would pick up the phone to check out texts while driving, as well as proving a \"special relationship\" exists between texter and recipient to influence the recipient picking up.

The company has agreed to take steps to prevent similar incidents in the future, and Ailes's departure from the company is seen as a major blow to his reputation.\n\nIn related news, Ailes's attorney, Charles Harder, has requested that New York magazine and writer Gabriel Sherman preserve all documents related to Ailes, a not-so-subtle threat of possible legal action in response to the magazine's article about sexual harassment at the network. However, it is unclear whether Harder will follow through with legal action.\n\nOverall, the news surrounding Roger Ailes and Fox News has been a major topic of discussion in recent months, and it has sparked a wider conversation about sexual harassment and the culture of power in the media industry.

According to a new report by the Economic Policy Institute, the average CEO of the top 350 companies in the US earned 312 times more than their workers in 2017. This pay gap has been growing rapidly since the 1990s, with CEOs earning an average of $18.9 million in compensation in 2017, while workers' wages have been stagnant. The report also found that the pay of top executives has outpaced the growth of the stock market and corporate profits, with CEO compensation increasing by 979% between 1978 and 2017, compared to a 637% increase in the S&P 500 index. The report suggests that the pay gap is driven by the increasing concentration of wealth among the top 1% of earners, and that it has negative consequences for the economy and society as a whole. The report also notes that the pay gap is not limited to the top 1% of earners, but is a widespread phenomenon that affects many workers. The report concludes that the pay gap is a major issue that needs to be addressed in order to promote economic fairness and reduce income inequality.

Scott Stevens was a successful Ohio finance exec whose life started unraveling in 2006 after a trade show in Vegas. For six years, his gambling habit spiraled out of control: He sneaked off to gamble when his wife thought he was working, embezzled nearly $4 million from his firm, and drained his family's savings—until the day in 2012 he decided to end his life. After his suicide, Stacy started researching gambling addiction (she hadn't even known about her husband's problem) and filed suit against the West Virginia casino where he was a regular, as well as the maker of the slot machines there. Experts relay how casinos track and target addicted gamblers, supply ready flows of cash via on-site ATMs, and offer plenty of perks to keep them coming back. But it's the modern-day slot machines themselves, with deceptive technology called virtual reel mapping, that seem to be designed to lull gamblers into a trance—or what the industry refers to as \"continuous gaming productivity\"—so they don't stop playing. While the casinos and machine manufacturers place the blame for gambling addictions on individuals, Terry Noffsinger, the lead attorney for the Stevens suit, says these addictive machines are not due to \"negligence. It's intentional.\" Stacy Stevens lost her case in West Virginia, but Noffsinger believes the movement to hold casinos accountable for addicts will gain momentum, much like how the tobacco industry eventually paid for sickening its own customers. \"The public is learning more about it,\" he says.

{"pred": " The news reports on a study that found that men who delay starting a family are more likely to have \"geekier\" sons. The study, conducted by King's College London, analyzed data from 15,000 twins and found that sons of older fathers scored higher on a \"Geek Index\" that measures non-verbal IQ, focus, and social aloofness. The study also found that daughters were not affected by their father's age. The researchers believe that the trend of delayed parenthood may lead to a \"society of geniuses\" that can solve the world's problems. However, they also warn that older sperm is more prone to genetic errors, which can increase the risk of autism and schizophrenia. The study's findings suggest that individual families should not make decisions about parenthood based on the results, but rather consider the overall risks and benefits. The researchers also believe that some genetic traits inherited from older fathers may affect both geekiness and autism. Overall, the study provides new insights into the relationship between paternal age and offspring traits, and highlights the importance of considering the potential risks and benefits of delayed parenthood.

More specifically, they tend to score higher on what the researchers call the \"geek index,\" reports the Guardian. And this is clearly seen as a positive: \"If you look at who does well in life right now, it’s geeks,\" says Magdalena Janecka at King’s College London. The geek index, she explains, is determined by such factors as ability to focus, non-verbal IQ scores taken at age 12, and social aloofness. The latter trait may sound like a negative, but the BBC frames it as the boys not being overly concerned with fitting in. A mother's age appears to have no impact. The team studied more than 7,000 sets of twins in the UK. The average geek score for boys born to dads 25 or younger is 39. It goes up to 41 when dads had the child between 35 and 44, and jumps to 47 when dads were 50 or older. The impact was less pronounced on girls, and more pronounced when measuring science, tech, engineering, and math scores. Kids born to fathers 50 or older were 32% more likely to earn at least two A's on standardized tests than children born to men aged under 25, the researchers report in Translational Psychiatry. They calculate that 57% of the geek index score is inherited, with possible overlap between genes that contribute to a high geek score and to autism. “Our primary hypothesis is that higher levels of those ‘geeky’ traits in offspring of older men are mainly due is due to characteristics of the fathers themselves,\" Janecka tells Newsweek. \"Men who decide to delay fatherhood often do so due to their extended career and educational pursuits, and likely themselves display higher levels of ‘geekiness.’” (Younger fathers are also likelier to die younger.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 8472}

The storm's center was located about 30 miles south of Key West, Florida, and was moving northwest at a speed of 8 mph. The storm's maximum sustained winds were near 130 mph, and it was expected to remain a powerful hurricane as it moved through the Florida Keys and near Florida's west coast.\n\nThe storm caused widespread power outages, with over 170,000 homes and businesses losing electricity. The National Weather Service issued a tornado warning for a wide swath of Monroe, Miami-Dade, and Broward counties in South Florida. The storm also caused flooding in some areas, with water levels rising by 4 feet in some places.\n\nDespite the storm's intensity, it was not as destructive as initially feared. The storm's trajectory shifted to the west, potentially sparing Tampa and Miami from a direct hit. However, St. Petersburg could still get a direct hit, and the city was under a state of emergency.\n\nThe storm also caused damage in the Caribbean, particularly in the French and Dutch islands. The French island of St. Martin was particularly hard hit, with 70% of homes damaged or destroyed.\n\nIn response to the storm, the U.S. government declared a state of emergency in Florida, and the National Guard was deployed to assist with evacuations and relief efforts. The storm also caused disruptions to air travel, with many flights canceled or delayed.\n\nOverall, Hurricane Irma was a powerful and destructive storm that caused significant damage and disruption in the Caribbean and Florida.
